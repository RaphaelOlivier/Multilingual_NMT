( Arabic ) I &apos;m going to look at the dog of TreeHugger from Lagos , and the name of the dog and a mass .
I was born in a family and a second class .
My wife was five years old when his father died , but when I was born , I was born .
I didn &apos;t have no mistake , they had to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was so lucky .
My mother was 12 kids .
There &apos;s only five children who were only five times .
Imagine what my grandfather was .
What I know is women who were nonsmokers , or the kids who were going to be able to win .
When I went to school .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So , I went to school .
Unfortunately , my country didn &apos;t have a lawyer for a girl , and so I was traveling in a hospital , but I couldn &apos;t .
And my father raised me in America .
I went to America .
I started my education .
And as I started , there was a Palestinian chick .
You know , when I took college , I didn &apos;t know that I was talking about my family and my country .
A month later , I didn &apos;t know .
My family was in the hospital to win .
As soon as I was traveling , I gave my family in America .
I wanted them to be safe .
Where was my heart ?
My heart was in Argentina .
And when you look at what happens from my neighborhood , my heart ached .
I really wanted to go back to my country , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that .
I was a old job .
I &apos;ve been in a university .
And here &apos;s what I was going to have to do .
When I went to the top of the <unk> , and you see 12 million dollars . Five million dollars .
About 90 percent of them were women and children , most men were beaten or killed , and you know , when I was in the Himalayas , I was in the bathroom .
When I spent the study , I &apos;ve got things that you can &apos;t imagine .
I saw five million kids who died and fallen , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I saw a young woman who couldn &apos;t go , not to go , to be a education , for which it wasn &apos;t a place for life .
I saw the boys who lost their parents and their home , they were his family .
It was a very exciting thing .
In that moment , we talk about the transformation .
So I asked myself , &quot; What can I do for these people ? &quot;
How can I help them ?
So I realized education changed my life .
She changed me , gave me a mistake .
At that moment , I realized that I had to have a little three-dimensional education and health , and I began to work .
Do you imagine what I was doing ?
No , because that &apos;s not because education has been a boy .
And that &apos;s because the Dalai capriciousness was called <unk> .
It &apos;s hard to go and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who I am ?
Have I got me ? Oh , no .
This is why I had to copy the eye in this community .
How did I do this ?
I spent research and search , and I &apos;ve spent it .
I was going to go .
I was 80 years old .
He was a horse .
I went to him .
He looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , the woman . How can I be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go with you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go with you . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go with him .
At one year , we had 25 schools , and 15 children who were in these schools . It &apos;s amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you .
Of course , we &apos;re working , we open teachers , and we &apos;re teaching our students , their minds , their minds , and of course , and we spend all of the <unk> . One day , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to tell you , and I &apos;ll tell you what I &apos;m going to tell you , and I &apos;ll tell you what I &apos;m going to tell you , and I &apos;ll tell you what I &apos;m going to tell you .
One day , I was in a office in <unk> , <unk> .
And I saw how my team would go to the room , put the door and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re going to do what you &apos;re doing ?
You &apos;re <unk> . You know what this is .
You know what your life is .
But as a modulation , you need to be husband .
You need to lose and worry about ourselves .
I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ?
So I &apos;ve been invited to myself .
They went up . Let &apos;s go .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a little bit of people .
I was invited them with the email and I wanted to print the shoes .
They stopped , he said she would stop a bed .
Of course , their voice , the voice that they talk to me with me , is very angry . I was really scared .
But I was grateful , I was a husband .
They asked them , &quot; What is you doing ? &quot;
What do you do ? &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked at them , and they looked at me , and they looked at me , and I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve learned a girl . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not a good house .
So we &apos;re looking at some students .
And the Koran says that if you read the President of women , ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And then they started to talk to it .
And at this moment , I was going to put them up , and they went out and started a little bit of fun .
My team started to go to the office .
And three students , and we were invited to teach them .
They sent the employees out of the clinic .
He was born with mother and children .
I &apos;ve got a little bit of the same night .
We took all the <unk> that you just can imagine .
I was happy . I was fascinated with my work .
One four brothers , one of the gods , and I went back to California , and I went back to California , and suddenly we were invited to stop the age of the 1970s in the 1970s .
In the middle of the weekend , they thanked us .
And I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I can tell you .
What do you need ?
So we all need to do it .
And all right , at the end of the moment , if you need to be weak .
In the world , where you die .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
For the age of age , it &apos;s a little bit of flowers and kill .
I went back and they said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to drive you . &quot; &quot; I went to a car , and I went to a car , and I went to a car .
They &apos;re going to get them in school , not what else .
Everyone went back to home . Nobody danced .
I was just a parent . I lost a voice .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; How do I do this problem ?
They have hundreds of women to get education .
So , I sat , and suddenly , in this moment , we &apos;re going to talk about nature — in this moment , one of my wonderful clients were offered to show them .
She said , &quot; &quot; Hey ? &quot; &quot; I gave it .
She said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not you . What did it happen ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not you . What did it happen ? &quot; &quot;
But anyway , it didn &apos;t bother me .
You &apos;re going to help them . &quot; &quot; They went down .
In fact , I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get their teachers .
Today , these people are my best destiny .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It &apos;s called what education change people .
If you &apos;re trying to teach people .
( Laughter ) And the potential of women .
And I &apos;m sure ...
I live in the country that was beautiful and good .
I want to share with you .
It was a beautiful country .
We could go to where we wanted .
Do you know what happened from my country ?
Today , people can &apos;t go from home , not to talk about security .
But we want to go back back to our wife <unk> .
They &apos;re going to keep the seeds and our community in their jails .
So you can see it &apos;s going to go back .
I want to share with you .
He said that compassion and love can be the universe .
<unk> : Good man ?
Audience : Oh , let &apos;s look at it .
SS : The <unk> of a unique instrument , the <unk> of all of these things , <unk> with the black code , the <unk> of the <unk> , with the <unk> , and with a Ph.D.-level truck , to this piece of metal from a Ph.D.-level truck , and the turbine of the code .
Audience : I &apos;m going to be , if you &apos;re a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;re going to give you the best email .
Audience : What was the hell ?
We &apos;ve got to give us a positive balance .
Audience : Yeah , let &apos;s look at the iPad , if it &apos;s .
Audience : Be the worst .
And I &apos;m going to be a little bit with my shirt .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to go out of my shirt , and I &apos;m going to get a little bit at the top of three seven years .
Now , I &apos;ve learned who &apos;s wrong .
In the way , we took a program about the extent that most of the kids don &apos;t know .
When I realized that the soul is the ones that I look at on the screen , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a dog ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know whether I &apos;m going to be a dog ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know whether I was saying , or it was a big dream of my life .
They &apos;ve always been my friends , and the art always had my own face .
But the idea of the computer technology was the idea of creating the Reading &quot; &quot; <unk> Truth . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; The first thing , in my computer was a virus , I tried to get out of him , and then I thought , what if the virus has a little light in the center of the computer ?
Maybe there &apos;s a <unk> where they &apos;re going to do it ?
So it was a great shelter .
When I was 28 years old , I gave me how a computer on the stage and I took it .
So I was going to go to the computer technology .
The first thing I &apos;ve got was the Internet , and now I was going to be a quote of <unk> and <unk> .
I also devise a new fear that called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s about bees and other ingredients that are in politics , and why they &apos;re good .
If the mushrooms weren &apos;t afraid of these gaps , all of the tools that they get from the plants , we &apos;re going to be careful .
So I decided to use these amazing designs and do them with them .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Narrator : ( Music ) ( Applause ) Narrator : Who else !
We need to get the rest of the <unk> .
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my minds started with ideas , but what &apos;s the ideas ?
And the idea of the idea is that we can inspire the productivity .
The idea is , it &apos;s a new and new .
The idea of the idea is that the light is liquid .
If not ideas , we wouldn &apos;t exist where there wasn &apos;t the government or medical abilities , not be art , the culture , our own lives .
When I was 28 years old , I took my ideas and I started a campaign called &quot; &quot; The idea of God , &quot; &quot; and the idea of God is the idea of God for the planet .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m going to give a cultural balance and a bullying .
I &apos;m about 13 , and even though I went from a school in 2008 , my hometown of globalization began to be a lot more before .
You know , some of the rules that I &apos;ve always experienced was a art , and I wanted to dedicate it to the rest that I &apos;m doing , including my office .
After a few of the rest of the house , I thought , &quot; &quot; I thought , I can do this , and I could do it , and I had a little bit of the idea of cloth . &quot; &quot; I had a lot of idea of the information of cloth .
And I noticed that when I gave my product , I &apos;d put up to the street , &quot; &quot; How cool do you do ? Where can you go to the kitchen ? &quot; &quot;
And I also thought that I can do this and find a machine .
Because I was only 18 years old , this plan , I didn &apos;t have .
And I just knew what I want to show you to make beautiful things , and what I wanted to share with someone that I was getting in life .
And I gave me a bed , and I went to the garden and I went to the garden , and I went to the garden , and I got a name and I got a name , and I got a name for every other of my knee .
And I started to get more efficient , like bananas , hot and lifeless .
And that &apos;s what the product started to kill around the world , and I &apos;ve got clients in Sawyer , Ellen , Australia , Australia , Canada and other countries .
Of course , I &apos;ve got a lot of people to learn about the right way , like , like a computer name and <unk> , how to support relationships with their customers and for the fact that it &apos;s better or worse .
The students began to grow .
And one day , when I was 10 years old , I was obsessed from Mowgli .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me and my office in my garage .
A lot of who I &apos;m trying to do is why &apos;s my product ?
With a little age , I was really fascinated by the environment and to make sure that they live .
My parents had been taught me to get out of anyone who were less likely , and with the intelligence , and let me look at the world .
I &apos;ve learned that the piece of metal for the sound or even the process is so dangerous for people and planet , and I started my research , and I realized that even after it was going to be a problem for the world in the fact that I knew what to do with the rest of the soil .
The rest of the process of the process is growing up or from the rest of the dark piece of cloth .
This chain of air , it turns out it &apos;s clear for all of the other ones that their heart is .
So when I started with my office , I knew two things : all of my devices need to be ecolutionary , and that 10 percent of my money have to save the local and the global organizations .
( Applause ) So I think the part of the new symbol of freedom that don &apos;t just want to pay money , but to make a tool of the world .
And I believe that maybe I could be a blind degree , I &apos;m saving my age of generations of generations to live in a more sustainable life .
We live in large , different and beautiful world , and from that , I &apos;m still more trying to protect it .
What &apos;s happening in the world is just from your head and thinking — no .
All of us need to communicate from the heart , because that &apos;s the idea that we make the idea .
It &apos;s also the same thing , and the idea of the world is the idea of the world , so the ideas is going to be a crisis .
Thank you , all the world and the truth .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : You &apos;ve heard how my daughter talk about my parents who are on their loved women . Where ?
If you remember , please and immortality , maybe you can be ... Oh .
( Applause )
Here &apos;s a few of you , you know .
It &apos;s a very simple invention of a real invention .
They have these big collection of paper , they interact between their own <unk> .
Most of the boats you see on the screen is not a single star , but the collection of stars , or galaxies .
Now , let me give you some of these things , I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to see that we &apos;re going to see that we &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s not just beautiful , but more than that , I think , &quot; &quot; Well-makers the hell , they say , and they &apos;re useful .
Instead of the way the source of the greatest center of the universe .
And in my lab , the key thing is that the fundamental experiments of experiments that you can start to start on them .
I think there are four fundamental dimensions , and the first thing that I want to tell you is that there &apos;s no very big thing .
Well , what is a big ?
All right , this is the one of the one .
It &apos;s so clear that the light that comes through it , you say , say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and it says , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the light that comes out of it .
And if you look very carefully , you can see the difference around the ground .
To not be careful that this is a database of the amount of energy that &apos;s more than one billion billion tons of sun .
It &apos;s a <unk> , like the effects of the effects can be these systems .
But more of them , they have a very important thing .
And they &apos;re also responsible by the system , and if you &apos;re sure , we can think about them as a small part of the world .
And there are a lot of questions that can be in us , about the mission of the universe , like , &quot; &quot; How do it work ? &quot; &quot;
You can tell the study of these systems .
So , this is a amazing lesson .
The second thing is that these things are very expensive .
So , when you take a mouse , and you get all the light that you &apos;re traveling , then then you get this big , <unk> rock .
It &apos;s a <unk> tree .
And what we &apos;re seeing here is a really profound light .
And then the question is , if it doesn &apos;t exist , if it doesn &apos;t exist ?
And the answer is to be oxygen , gas dioxide , the gas of the lungs .
And the reason that the wind can be able to find in the last mile .
It &apos;s a huge sample of these systems , and they have the particles of gas , and they have a <unk> rate , and the average speed , in fact , is a <unk> .
This is the key idea , but this is just a study of the philosophy .
Now , there &apos;s also a lot of other things that are particularly important for us , and we &apos;re putting us , and then we absolve our understanding of physics of the physics of the body .
A third is a very <unk> .
To tell you about this , I need to tell you about the idea .
Most of the characteristics of the universe is not from atoms .
The croc died .
Most of the most beautiful things that we call the dark cortex .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s not very good , it &apos;s something that &apos;s not very good relationships , but in fact , we want to figure out more about this .
If you think about the physics of physics , you know what happens when we &apos;re going to stop something about each other .
And the same thing is not higher .
So how can we do that ?
To answer this question , I &apos;m going to tell you the question , &quot; What &apos;s going to be if you &apos;re going to do the hell ? &quot;
Look at you .
We remember that the <unk> of the universe like the universe of the universe is just a small one .
They tend to be invisible with dark properties , and that &apos;s what you can see in this particular <unk> .
<unk> is the mountain of gas , and of course , you can see a lot of <unk> .
And what &apos;s happening here is the essence of the Higgs boson in a very , very large scale .
And it &apos;s really important , because it means that it means very , very abstract effects that are difficult in the lab , can be able to be able to be able to see something that we can see in the ground .
So this is a very short thing .
And it &apos;s clear about why the unconscious bias can teach us about what &apos;s dark , the reason why the moral self can teach us about the physics of a very feminist , which is that they &apos;re so big .
The key thing is : physics is very strange .
And then it &apos;s also going to be really close to your own .
If there &apos;s something more exciting , it needs to be dark energy .
When I put the penny into the air , I bet he &apos;s going to breathe in the bed .
But I don &apos;t expect that he would be going to be a lot of more and more fast .
So the same way that the universe is made .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s made from the most low pace .
They &apos;re going to do this kind of fundamental structure of the name and call it dark energy .
And the truth is , we want to understand more about this .
Now , a little bit of a question that is the dark energy of the world in the universe in the world in the world in the greatest scale ?
Despite their organs , the structure can prevent their things more or a sprint .
And the problem of the universe in large scale is that it &apos;s terrible .
Let &apos;s look at the software revolution .
We need to ignore it .
I love to think about this , using a <unk> .
And I &apos;d like to figure out how a guest would be the most important thing — it &apos;s not the model of a little bit of a little bit of a car that was made .
The most important thing is to use the two major things .
So , I can teach you a lot of what the universe is in the greatest scale , looking at it , and these images are the sequel .
Lastly , I &apos;m going to take my TED Talk , but you can feel yourself with a little bit of anger .
And I mean , what I started to do with how a good thing is , and it took a few of these reasons , but how do they use them ?
Well , I want to tell you , I want to try to try to do the <unk> <unk> , when he asked them about cars .
This is what he said , &quot; &quot; If I ask people that they need to be , they say , &quot; &quot; We need to have a more more than the era of our society in a very large level of problems .
And the solution is not obvious .
They don &apos;t even die .
They &apos;re asking the extraordinary number of studies .
So , we need to be careful , so we need to look at innovation , but we also need to remember the diversity of innovation , and we also need to remember the diversity of innovation , and we also need to remember the diversity of innovation , when we &apos;re going to go back to the bottom .
And I &apos;m the best way to do this — design the universe around us . Thank you .
( Applause )
So imagine that you &apos;re sitting on the street in America , and then you go back to the front of the hill and say , &quot; &quot; You know , how does you call this scarf ?
And you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Look . Well , it &apos;s <unk> . &quot; &quot; This is George <unk> .
This is two pounds of the cylinder , and it says , &quot; &quot; Well , how good is this ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the sound of this ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s no name .
The name is the name of the name , <unk> — it &apos;s just <unk> between the flute . &quot; &quot; He goes , thank you , thank you very much and painted .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re going to walk on in the street , not in Japan , sitting at Japan and say , &quot; &quot; Listen , how is it called this ?
And they &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is about 17 , and it &apos;s <unk> . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but how is it called this ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Well , what is you saying about this ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; How is you saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
There &apos;s a name .
So here &apos;s a look at the <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s 14 , 15 , four , four , 18 , 19 , 19 .
In all of these neonics , there &apos;s a name . There &apos;s a name that &apos;s just <unk> between the soil .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s good , but how do you know your friends ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s just the stars .
And it &apos;s like 17 , the house one . You say , &quot; &quot; Wow . But I noticed , &quot; &quot; Ah , but I noticed that in the middle of the city , I noticed that in the end of the neighborhood . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , the hell of the genocide is not the difference of the genocide . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s the difference of the genocide . It &apos;s the way that they were doing .
And I think that was the first one , which was the house of the first one .
It was a second one that was built by a second two .
The third house is a house three . It &apos;s just . &quot; &quot; So , I &apos;m very glad that sometimes we need to live on the other side of the ground to understand something that we even don &apos;t even count , and to figure out that the absolute thing of the money .
Here &apos;s example , in China , there are the tools that believe that their job is to save your health .
So every month , if you don &apos;t cry , you &apos;re going to eat you , and if you don &apos;t cry , you don &apos;t pay them free , because they couldn &apos;t trust their work . They would be healthy if you &apos;re healthy , not if you &apos;re healthy , not if you &apos;re healthy , not if you &apos;re healthy , not if you &apos;re healthy , not if you &apos;re healthy , not if you &apos;re healthy , not if you &apos;re healthy , not if you &apos;re healthy , not if you
( Applause ) Now , there &apos;s a lot of music , and there &apos;s a little bit of &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; to be able to get a musical phrase . &quot; &quot; Well , two three .
But in the San York II , this is the middle of the phrase , the foundation of the sound .
You can hear it not just in the surprise , but in the way they &apos;re afraid of beauty , two , three , four , later .
And it &apos;s also the right thing .
( Laughter ) And it turns out that in every thing that &apos;s talking about Russia , there &apos;s a environment that &apos;s also true .
So let &apos;s don &apos;t forget that or in TED , or it &apos;s not that fear of the human idea in the sky is whether you think it can also be true .
<unk> <unk> .
