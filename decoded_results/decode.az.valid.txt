I was 11 years old , in the middle of the day , in front of my house , when I looked at a happy voice in our house .
My father listened to the news news in the little ▁ radio .
And then there was a symbol that we didn &apos;t have to be able to be able to be used , because it &apos;s the most ▁üzə .
He said , &quot; &quot; Go back ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I was my father .
I didn &apos;t know what this means , but I knew how my father was happy .
&quot; &quot; Now you can go to school . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You can go to school .
I was not a morning .
In fact , it &apos;s going to go to school .
I had spent eight years to go to Afghanistan , and I had a lot of time in school for girls .
So , in the next five years , I had to wear my siblings like a boy to go to the desert , and I would like to wear a happy school to go to the open school .
It was the only way that we can &apos;t afford education .
Every day , we would go from a different way that no one knows where we go .
We were able to fly our books into the marketplace , and you just can &apos;t see what we &apos;re looking at .
He was in a house in a house , which is a little bit like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
He was free time , but it would be horrible in the mountain .
Teachers , schools and parents , we all knew that we were able to get all of our life .
And sometimes , he was a week of a week that was a teenager , and he was a week of a week from my school .
We were afraid about what we were doing in our choice .
What do you see , the streaks ?
Do you know what we live in ?
We were mad , but yet , the school was where we wanted to be .
I was really lucky , and I was very lucky , and for me , I was a family of family and girls from a family .
I mean , it was an incredible person .
Afghanistan was a different idea in Afghanistan , her daughter , my mother , and my mother , and she was rejected by her father , and he was rejected by her father .
But my mother was a teacher .
It &apos;s it .
Two years ago , she went home , and she went home to a school for girls and women .
And my father — this was the first one that happened in family .
They didn &apos;t know that girls were going to get to school , and he didn &apos;t have any attention to her children , until the bottom of the pyramid , and even as a result , the risks were going to look at the risks .
So , my children were more dangerous to education .
In the early years , I would go to the talk , and I would see that you could see a light , and you can see a ray of light from the future , and you can see a ray of light from the future .
I went to my wife , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , my daughter , my daughter , you can lose everything in life .
You can get the rich eggs . You can see it in order to leave the house in the streets .
But the only thing that &apos;s going to happen with you is the only thing that &apos;s going to happen , and if you &apos;re going to take our arteries in school , you &apos;ll go to school and send you to school .
Now , if you &apos;re still going to go back ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 22 years old .
I grew up in a country that died in war .
I was not going to finish a few percent of my neighbors , and if my family education was going to end , and if my family education was so much , I would be able to do it .
Instead , I &apos;m standing here in front of you in front of you .
( Applause ) When I went back to the audience , one of the first people who had the first time to put me to school was my father , and I was my father .
He &apos;s not because I was a college , but I &apos;m also the first woman that I was born in the streets of the streets .
( Applause ) My parents believe me .
I have great dreams , my family is bigger than me .
In fact , I &apos;m not aware of a global global campaign to teach women to be educated .
And that &apos;s what women are going to go to school , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan .
And the best thing is that I see students who are happy in my school in my school .
And I see the parents , including my father , my father , and I see how they &apos;re helping girls .
It &apos;s like Namibia . I don &apos;t know him and the real name , but he &apos;s a father of my students .
A short month ago , he was going to go to the village with her daughter , and he took them in a few minutes from the earthquake .
When he was home , he played the phone , and the sound on the phone , and he would go to school , and he was going to go to school to go to school .
And he said , &quot; &quot; If you want to ask , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to fear my wife , and I &apos;m not going to fear my parent , and I &apos;m not going to fear my parent . &quot; &quot; And what I discovered about Afghanistan , sometimes , was , sometimes , what I discovered about Afghanistan , sometimes , is that every single one of us was standing on the world .
This is not what we &apos;re proud of .
In fact , their ancestors are very poor , and they &apos;re very poor , but in a community like ▁Ə , it &apos;s the support of men .
And when the girls went to school , the girls went to school — like you know , this was the ▁qey .
And in Afghanistan , the girls in Afghanistan are about three million .
( Applause ) As you look at Afghanistan from Afghanistan , it looks very different .
I &apos;m trying to understand what they &apos;re talking about .
And I &apos;m afraid that I &apos;m afraid of these changes after the U.S. military in the U.S. military .
But if I want to teach Afghanistan to teach Afghanistan , we think about the hundreds of people and people who are willing to participate with them , a light future , and it changes a sense of progress .
So , I mean , Afghanistan is the country of the country and the opportunity to see it , and the girls who met the 1950s are more likely to me every day .
They &apos;re a lot of dreams like me .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
They &apos;re going to go into the seas . And everyone who has made this fresh is that you know that if you &apos;re going to go down to two hours , you can see that if you go down to two or two hours .
And you can see that you can see the ▁nümunələri patterns here , but all of them , a world for art , is fascinating .
It &apos;s a ▁göz , ▁t , ▁göz , ▁göz .
And this is the air pattern . And finally .
e , this is a ▁f design .
It doesn &apos;t know that it &apos;s completely , all of a sudden .
This is the unknown world . And that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about today .
It &apos;s a little bit of the ocean .
It &apos;s going to be a place where it &apos;s going to go into a place , ▁q and ▁ .
And he sees her teeth , and he sees a little bit harder .
Let &apos;s look at a little bit . Go back to the ▁sağ : the network , it &apos;s the left , it &apos;s a little bit of the left .
It goes back to a step , and it goes back to two .
Hi . I &apos;m ▁ba . I &apos;m ▁ba . This is a giant forest .
Don &apos;t follow them . Get them around . It gives them the same as a sea .
It &apos;s lost .
This is the rock game . We learn a lot of new things .
And it &apos;s a ▁s . Okay ? Now , Jerry was scared .
And when it turns out , it says , &quot; &quot; Wow , it was seen .
It &apos;s going to be great when the best thing is possible .
It &apos;s ▁edir . Let &apos;s go back to it .
One . Five . Five .
In the horizon , who is the history of the first devil , but the Middle world , the history of the world .
All of the things that didn &apos;t matter .
We can see the first public world .
And I never had a panic .
Now , I don &apos;t know that I &apos;m not ashamed of my mind .
So the night of the night , the lights of China are different than sea .
It &apos;s a part of the border .
It &apos;s like a refugee refugee refugee .
I would like to meet the horrible fate .
And I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not going to have a lot of time .
And when I was speaking about anything else , I was not talking about anything else .
And I asked questions to answer questions .
This is a police named a police .
But most of them have been arrested by China .
I was very lucky for me , because I was very lucky , a lot of South Korea was so lucky .
And after we tried a new language , after we did work , all life could be flat .
It &apos;s not going to be in South Korea .
We all were mothers , but it &apos;s about six years later , and after the same time , we all had sex .
I &apos;m not South Korea or North Korea ?
So I started to plan them about how to save them .
And I went back to the northeast coast of North Korea .
My parents don &apos;t have to be able to deal in China .
And I &apos;d like to look at the idea of thinking .
I was exploring my family .
But after a short time , it &apos;s in the mud River .
We were very lucky , but my family went from prison at the end of South Korea .
I don &apos;t know what I didn &apos;t know .
I said , &quot; &quot; It was the only money to get out of prison .
This is my life of my life .
They start to spend a lot of money or money .
And I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m sure that
This is a kid that we design in 2007 .
We &apos;ve been building it .
Go back to the roof of the building .
And you know , you know , kids love a lot of time .
It looks like this .
Why did we build this ?
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be a ▁S . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be a ▁S . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be a ▁S . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be the ▁S .
And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; How do you pray from my book ?
The kids fall down . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And , of course , the government of the government , they said , &quot; &quot; The ▁S must be natural . &quot; &quot; Of course , governments are like , &quot; &quot; The ▁S must be God .
We &apos;ve been working around the trees , but we went around the trees .
There are three networks in the building .
They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; ▁sür . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called the ▁sür . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not called the ▁sür . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s called the ▁sür . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what they say . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the ▁t . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the ▁t . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the ▁t . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the ▁t . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; This is the ▁t . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s called the ▁sür . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what they say . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s called the ▁sür . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s called the ▁sür . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what
But it &apos;s used with other motivation .
They &apos;re all together .
The kids are all together .
( Laughter ) Sometimes , sometimes , it &apos;s going to take 40 children in the sky .
And this guy you see in this , this guy , he loves him so much , he ate him .
( Laughter ) And if it gets more efficient , they &apos;re sitting on the roof .
It looks like a very fresh thing .
They look like a ▁mey .
( Laughter ) When I &apos;m cooking .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We continued to slow up , because we want to see the kids , but we want to see it .
It &apos;s very high , but you can see it .
And this is the place to stop , all sorts of water — all sorts of water .
You can see that the ▁çe flies are going to be your friends in your kids , and it &apos;s a normal thing , and it &apos;s normal .
But you can see that the boy , you can see , don &apos;t get them into your hand , and we can see them with water .
( Laughter ) The next time it &apos;s long at the end of the year , it &apos;s completely open .
There &apos;s no one from the desert and the desert .
And that means that the ▁ of the ▁ is made from the roof .
They don &apos;t have obsessions .
There are no contracts .
Most of the kids start to be afraid in the front of the mouth .
But it doesn &apos;t have any reason in this session .
Because there &apos;s no one here .
He says , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t want to be in the corner of the corner , you can go and go and go .
It &apos;s a basket , where it will go back to the desert .
( Laughter ) I said , many of you are happy to hide .
And here they go and go back again .
That &apos;s what it makes .
Secondly , we &apos;re very important to be bold .
You know , kids are better than sound .
They don &apos;t go together .
When kids are in my office , kids are in the middle of the journey .
You know , we &apos;re surrounded with the sound of the sound , and the rituals .
They have to sound .
And you know , you know , your friends are very loud .
You don &apos;t have to wear it .
You know , we &apos;re trying to control everything .
That &apos;s right .
And I mean , we &apos;re going to go down in the winter in the winter .
They &apos;re going to go away .
It &apos;s the sun in the waters of 50 degrees .
We don &apos;t .
We &apos;re beaten in the Maldives .
So we &apos;ve tried to be in the beach .
We have to make this kind of act with kids .
And here &apos;s my classroom .
They need to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) This kid is in the middle .
It &apos;s the room room .
This is the ▁əl .
They &apos;re good conversations here .
There are a lot of networks in your hands .
And then he tried to hold my head on the top of the comet .
( Laughter ) Let me do more . ( Laughter )
Every year , there &apos;s no window , no window .
In San Francisco , it &apos;s going to be here .
And this is the size of the field , which was built in the top of the comet .
There are five meters long , and it &apos;s seven feet .
It doesn &apos;t go very much .
We need to think of security .
Let &apos;s take a girl for a girl for a girl .
He tried to go back .
It &apos;s the beginning .
Okay , but it &apos;s a perfect gift .
It &apos;s powerful . He &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) Here &apos;s how much security you can &apos;t get out of the tree .
And then we took other kids .
You know , it &apos;s very mystifying .
( Laughter ) We try to learn how to get the car in prison .
And when they &apos;re a little bit less than kids , there &apos;s always always a little bit of time .
In those words , they learn to help each other .
This is a society , and we make these kinds of opportunities .
This is a little bit of a boy that is a boy who &apos;s a boy from nine or nine percent of her children .
The generation is 3.26 meters .
It &apos;s not small .
So this little morning went six yards down .
But interestingly , it &apos;s still happening .
When kids are in this classroom , kids are going to get 3,000 meters per day .
And the kids here here have the highest Prize in the classroom .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know them . I don &apos;t know them .
We go to the roof . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They &apos;re growing for flowers . ( Laughter )
I think they don &apos;t have to protect them , but they need to protect them .
They need to be a black t-shirt .
Because we teach them how to live in life .
I think architecture is possible to change the world and change the lives of people .
This building is one of the steps that the child has been allowed to change life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In the 1970s , I &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the same two years in China in the 1970s .
When I was reading the first school , I was going to be able to go from the government of all the companies in the government .
But my mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And they wanted to say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No .
And it was a reason that happened after the Everglades , which is the only way to get good and secure care .
I love my job .
But my dream was to be a Chinese champion .
So I play my friend , and I play my friend .
I have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a shower , and I was trying to go to this village , and I was trying to go to a school school .
And I wrote a letter to my school , and I wrote a letter to the radio show .
But they loved my own self .
Nobody didn &apos;t believe anyone else .
But my friends would have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be treated as I was , and they were like me .
So I realized that when I was 15 years old , I realized that I was born .
My wish wasn &apos;t going to happen .
I was afraid about my life as the end of my life , and I was afraid that I would be happy .
But it was unfair .
I decided to do other ways .
You don &apos;t have any way to do the way ?
I made books .
I made this book from this book that I &apos;ve been talking about with this book that I was talking about , and I made this book that I was talking about . &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; ▁F ▁ailəsini . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; ▁F ▁ailəsini . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; ▁Je ▁E . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; ▁Je ▁E . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; ▁Je ▁E . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; ▁Je ▁E . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; ▁Je ▁E . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; ▁Je ▁E . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; ▁Je ▁E . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; ▁daha , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And I learned to be able to learn this book .
&#91; &quot; &quot; This is a series of &quot; &quot; A series of &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Ronald : I met the first book when I was in the United States , when I was in the United States ?
Of course , it &apos;s a book that was not going to be in China .
It &apos;s about &quot; &quot; Rrrrrrr BAM . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about New York City .
There &apos;s no benefit for the horse . I can see it .
The Bible is interesting , a little bit weird .
( Laughter ) This is another day .
But I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to worry to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dad and religion . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Dad and religion . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Dad and religion are going to respect me . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to talk to you . &quot; &quot;
And I thought , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s different than the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ət &quot; &quot; in my relationship to my friends .
He decided to compare me to my relationship to new cultural cultures .
It can teach you so much .
For example , this map seemed weird to me , because in China , we &apos;re developing this map .
I didn &apos;t even have to be in the center of China .
Actually , the map shows the world .
It &apos;s not a new thing .
This is a standard use in science .
In fact , there are science institutions like the Islamic audience and Darwinian literature .
It &apos;s helping us to understand the science of scientists and the purpose of science .
And I said , if I tried to work on the interview , why do you live in your everyday life ?
So , I started reading books .
I mean , people who are in the same case — &#91; &quot; &quot; The ▁Ben &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; John Adams . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) David ▁Is : David Man , or the same ▁əh in the same world .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Wugs &quot; &quot; : &#91; &quot; &quot; Warren ▁ , &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; Warren fet , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause
It was the economic , political and spirit .
For this , these are all psychology : love , fear and social .
You know , you know , you don &apos;t know language , you know , two languages read the book .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; ( Beatboxing ) ( Beatboxing ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Frank ▁W : Keith ▁W , I found the name of the Titanic , but I found other things .
For example , I realized , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s hard . &quot; &quot; And I realized , &quot; &quot; Queerer happy . &quot; &quot; And for example , I realized , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s hard . &quot; &quot; And for example , I realized , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s hard . &quot; &quot; And for example , I realized , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s hard . &quot; &quot; And for example , I realized , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s hard . &quot; &quot; And for example , I realized , &quot; &quot; Queerer . &quot; &quot;
The word &quot; &quot; new Truth . &quot; &quot; Yes !
( Laughter ) And I started books , and now I &apos;m going to get the ▁sehr role of people in the time .
I don &apos;t even have to be able to be alone or not .
Your wish is nothing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see other people .
And I began to believe that the only purpose of the desire is not going to happen .
The fundamental purpose of the wish is that our desires and happiness have to allow us to act with the outcome of happiness and happiness .
It &apos;s possible to do that .
So I &apos;m here here , and I &apos;m happy , and I &apos;m happy , and I &apos;m happy with a very common motivation .
I &apos;m telling you , &quot; &quot; books always do you ! &quot; &quot; I said .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in office , and one of the things that you &apos;re going to go to the window is that you &apos;re going to go into your room , and they &apos;re drawn into your room .
It &apos;s just going to go .
They don &apos;t do information about it .
We &apos;re not going to try to work today .
You &apos;re not going to get it . What would you say .
And you ask me , &quot; &quot; Why am my shoelaces ? &quot; &quot; Well , I say , &quot; &quot; Why am my shoelaces ? &quot; &quot; Well , here &apos;s the morning , and you &apos;re in office , and you &apos;re in office .
( Laughter ) And this is a woman who has met you from a woman who was listening to you .
And this is my siz meeting , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t go back to this two hours , like I want to go back to my desk . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , our job is how good our colleagues are .
And I &apos;m talking about a lot more valuable than the office .
Time , it &apos;s your time .
In fact , I believe that I believe that it &apos;s a terrifying reason , which is a terrifying reason .
( Laughter ) And I think you can tell you , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t want to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
It &apos;s a fascinating ▁re — oh , oh , oh , oh , I &apos;m going to go to the meeting , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the meeting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ▁İ is important , right ?
In every company in the 20th century , the success of the success is the success of the success .
And a meeting that goes out there can be really good .
But in the last few years , it &apos;s a very recent number of years .
We &apos;re going to do it . ( Laughter ) And why that &apos;s why it &apos;s not not going to do a good meeting , not to think about the good meeting , the compassionate syndrome , who we are .
I mean , I &apos;m sure that SETI is global terrorism .
Let me show you .
A few years ago , I wrote a video in Dorset , and I had all sorts of bad sacrifices that you can be in this video .
This is a way that we hate about five minutes video video video .
It &apos;s a meeting of the office , which is an app to control , and I &apos;m here to be here .
They don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do .
And everybody left here .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a word .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s look at a quick way .
( Video ) Now our purpose today is to deal in a very important point .
Like a group , who are it ?
Hi , Joe . I &apos;m working on home today .
( Laughter ) Hi Tom . Thank you for you .
I said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a lot of people we want to teach , which is , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not doing that .
A group of people — ( Laughter ) ! Oh , who are it ?
No ? That &apos;s what happened . ( Laughter )
Yes , I met me .
A few weeks later , 500 years later , 500 people in the country are actually going to look at this video in the country .
And three years later , this video will look at 1,000 times every month .
If it &apos;s used to look at these numbers , it used to be used by companies .
I &apos;ve been exploring the original expedition to find the physical objects .
And I think it &apos;s hard to find the reality that it &apos;s useful and used to be useful and used .
And I started with a series of research , and I began to learn how happy they were in their families , and what they &apos;re very happy to do in their lives .
And if you only have a third example of the average level , the players are familiar .
( Laughter )
First of the first time .
They would be afraid of the human sound , and they &apos;re afraid of human sound .
It &apos;s one of the simplest sentences .
And what &apos;s happening is that the Western culture is not full of the world .
This is the last version of Sweden in Sweden .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can see that you can see that you can &apos;t understand that you can &apos;t understand the value of autism .
They had to be able to understand what the participants have to do , and they had to understand that they were going to be able to make a shower .
The micro-world of Darwin said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; in the book in the book .
Before we were in the &apos; 70s , and then he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same . &quot;
This science was shown in the theory of Darwin , and it &apos;s a way to help people feel better .
It may be a panic .
( Laughter )
I &apos;m a teenager , and I &apos;m a teenager , and I &apos;m a teenager , and I &apos;m a teenager .
Or if you get a lot of ▁k , or a lot of ▁k , you can &apos;t wear a very old cup of pants , or I &apos;m going to wear a very old shower .
I &apos;m ▁May ▁Ş . I &apos;m a professor of the ke of the community of the community .
We &apos;re looking at the ▁para things , and we &apos;re looking at some of the things that are connected with creativity , science , science , science , science , science , science , science , science , science , science , science .
If we live in Mars in Mars , you &apos;re very busy with things .
Some of us are going to give us a sense of what we &apos;re going to do .
But let &apos;s say , there &apos;s a lot of things .
We &apos;re going to change them as the ▁f of the police accident , and we &apos;re going to turn them up . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We want to change with bad ideas . ( Laughter ) We want to change with bad experiences .
Let me show you a example of the bad idea .
I brought it to myself , and it &apos;s to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do this .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; ▁Q &quot; &quot; company .
It &apos;s right . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s right .
( Laughter ) They &apos;ve been able to do this in the school of the school of school .
It &apos;s a ▁p thing that &apos;s called ▁R ▁S .
You can use a lot of things from the factory devices , but that &apos;s because students are going to be able to be a ▁mar .
( Laughter ) So this is working : if you go to this , you &apos;re going to go into this , you &apos;re going to go into it .
It &apos;s something like this .
I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) Mmm . This is a little bit of tidying up .
We &apos;re trying to try to try to try to try to study this science .
And the truth is , this is going to go .
( Laughter ) Thank you , thank you , thank you . ( Laughter )
Of course , the question is : what do these devices find in the lane ?
And the answer is , yeah , you can find your body in your body .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We don &apos;t only know what we &apos;ve done in my hands , but we need to choose that we don &apos;t know .
On the bottom of here , the universe is probably , probably , this : ▁E , astronauts and consumers are always using this .
People remember that they didn &apos;t know , they didn &apos;t know .
We &apos;ve been exploring everything in my hand . We &apos;ve been able to compare the numbers of stereotypes and the numbers .
Here we did .
We took two boxes , a picture of the ▁rəsmi ▁qeyd , and that &apos;s one of them .
And 50 percent of the experiments were successful . ( Laughter ) So , then we &apos;re going to get this result .
This was interesting , a little example of things that we do .
It &apos;s a series of months from three months . Every book has a role .
This is about the future of the imagination .
Are people going to go back to people , right ?
And I have to think about this , and I have a sense of this thing , and what they see is that people are going to go back .
Every decade , average is three seconds .
It &apos;s interesting .
You want to think about something like a ▁şey or scientific education .
Are you talking about God and religion ?
This is like you want to ask the story of the book .
These are two different things .
I &apos;m not spending my hands , it &apos;s the essence .
It &apos;s the way to think about what they &apos;re thinking about .
It &apos;s the way that you don &apos;t want to look at words for all the grasses .
What is a better thing to do ? The world is further than the other galaxy , and the other galaxies , and the size of the stratosphere , but the space of the planet , but the space of the planet , but the space of the planet ?
&quot; &quot; The ▁S &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; ▁P , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ▁P , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ▁P , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ▁P &quot; &quot; ?
And the question is , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a good question ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What &apos;s a more real question .
When you knew that there &apos;s another world , we have to know that there &apos;s no world in this world .
What do you have to do ? Why do you help the Bible to help the Bible ? &quot; &quot; Did you do that in the Bible ?
( Laughter ) So , these things were the opposite of the ▁S ris .
I listened to them to sit on the wreck : &quot; &quot; Then it &apos;s a great thing .
I think you have to tell you a second step . &quot; &quot; And this slide makes all these smart designs .
That &apos;s what &apos;s wrong .
( Applause ) You can be ÜZ ▁B . But it doesn &apos;t tell anything . It doesn &apos;t tell anything .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
So this is for the design of design for design .
You know , scientists , scientists , are very similar things , as dark matter , as dark matter , as we realized what it is .
This is the beginning of the optimism for science .
And the idea is that this is the last shot of the DARPA plan , which is the last line .
But it &apos;s also the same question . What is it more real ?
It &apos;s a machine machine , or it &apos;s ▁xət or ▁sa ?
This is a dendritic picture of my house in California in California .
It looks like this , and it &apos;s like that , because this is the insect .
No technology is called &quot; &quot; ▁P , &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t have to be a computer .
This image is made with &quot; &quot; ▁Ko . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m using this pattern .
And he was ready to get out of the flower , and he was ready to see it .
It was ready to film — it &apos;s so much .
( Laughter ) And most of these things are real , or maybe you can think that some of them are real , but it &apos;s very simple .
If we take more more , we &apos;re looking at the science of science , and in science .
For example , there was two problems in Saturn in Saturn .
First , there was nothing about the planetary rings .
Secondly , it was crazy , and it was crazy . So , he didn &apos;t understand a lot of attention .
He wrote this kind of letter : &quot; I found that the planet is three objects . &quot;
And he decided to say that this was what he saw .
So , as well as the good planet , you can &apos;t have a good sense of physical modification .
This was when he was doing this .
This is a mirror of the book that &apos;s going to be able to understand the image of the Huygens Huygens , where they &apos;re trying to understand the cloud of the Huygens Islands .
And it was to do these two things . The Earth rings and the solar system , there was a good part of the space and the solar system , and so we had to understand that the probe was more fast than Saturn .
We didn &apos;t see the walls of the sky .
And that &apos;s what it means .
The worst thing is that science is full of science .
One of the reasons that we believe that Jesus is not aware of the virtues is that we &apos;re just aware of it , and then I &apos;m going to touch it in serious reasons .
We &apos;ve been able to see each other .
This is in Mars .
In the 1970s , NASA was not able to see other images from NASA , and people thought that it was created by ▁mar .
Here &apos;s a picture from 2007 .
If you don &apos;t notice your eye , you can see it .
When you look at your eyes , you &apos;re able to put a look at the image of the extra image , so you &apos;re losing the quality of data .
If I remember that you have to look at it , you can &apos;t see it , because we have to be able to recognize them .
Stories are important for us .
And of course , smile . It &apos;s easy to see each other .
You see the smile in Mars .
( Laughter ) And when the dinosaurs were hungry , they would see the clitoris .
Come down . Do you see a little bit of glass waves ?
Or if the geometry were elephants ?
They &apos;re ▁ .
( Laughter ) 1970 , the ▁ç was born in 1989 .
I was five bucks to see the palace , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m just about five bucks to see the palace . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s in the face of ▁xəbərdar .
Here &apos;s Nepal and ▁W , and it was in the Vietnam . Right ?
It &apos;s really good that this work is really good because it &apos;s flat , it &apos;s flat , it &apos;s flat , and you see these pictures , and you see these pictures — people who are looking at the image .
This is a rə of the window of the window of Manhattan .
Here I &apos;m going to show you , here I &apos;m going to show you here in the ▁pendir ▁pendir , and I didn &apos;t know that I could touch it in the Lower Side . Yes , it &apos;s America .
( Laughter ) So , he took 16 trillion dollars to do this ▁se . ( Laughter )
And what would you mean now ? Did you pray ? ( Laughter )
He was a girl who was ▁bü , who was in the United States in the 19th century .
I &apos;m a reporter in er ▁F .
I went to me to see that .
There was a lot of people .
It &apos;s a lot of people who have a lot of people who have been working with cars , and we have a lot of people who are working with trees .
We were more interested .
You can &apos;t see it — this is eerie , and I &apos;m a great name , two , two , two , two , two , two , two .
People are lost thousands of feet tall .
We &apos;re going to go back and go back to the sky .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , in the way , it was a picture that was in front of my husband and anger . &quot; &quot; It was a picture that was a picture .
And this is the picture of the other side of the other side . They started to be ▁S .
In every hand , most of you may be a wonderful wonderful .
( Laughter ) So this is a really cool thing now , or it &apos;s awesome ? ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to end up with a different example of this , and I &apos;ll end up with a pencil .
There &apos;s a movie called &quot; &quot; ck sound &quot; &quot; , ▁May ▁Ki , talking about us talking about us .
And when it comes back , I &apos;m actually talking about the dead of the dead .
It turns out , everybody knows .
It &apos;s one of the dead dead dead .
( Laughter ) And this film , these messages , these messages are covered in electrons .
And I went from a website called ▁R artist .
This is the most famous .
This is a very strange song of the famous song .
( Laughter ) If you look at the green , it &apos;s not bad .
This is what we write by the Library of Klein .
The two ways are going to change the way to change the way .
Don &apos;t hear every day .
Now , let &apos;s sound on the opposite . Do you have to hear the secret message in the next word ?
( Music ) The word &quot; &quot; tan &#93; &quot; &quot; — ( Music )
( Music ) What are you doing ? Audience : Oh !
Do you know the worst devil ?
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you what you don &apos;t hear about the eye of your brain , and to listen .
( Music ) It &apos;s impossible to hear what &apos;s happening . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to end with a small , wet story .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Star Trek . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; .
We &apos;re looking at opportunities in the face of people .
There &apos;s a bird in England .
It &apos;s very popular in Leviticus : called ▁Ka Square .
There are so much songs .
In 2005 , he was the best five songs in 2005 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we &apos;re a million bike . &quot; &quot; The story is the story of the British of England .
There &apos;s a part of the words .
( Music ) It &apos;s 12 billion light years away . This is ▁güm . It doesn &apos;t say that it &apos;s right . But I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s right . But I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to do your life .
LM : All right . It &apos;s a long number of years .
America would say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to go down about six light years . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) My friend ▁S , ▁zər physics , the micro-world of &quot; &quot; Great Scarlet . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called science fiction , and it &apos;s called the Great Scarlet .
In this case , &quot; &quot; The West &quot; &quot; wrote about the song of the word &quot; &quot; The Abyss . &quot; &quot; And we can see how far we &apos;re in the street .
It &apos;s 12 , 13 billion light years , and it &apos;s not predictable .
We know how much it is , but we know how much it is .
So , we can say that it &apos;s not true , but we can say that it &apos;s very close to the right number .
And that &apos;s weird , after the writing of the manuscript , and he said , &quot; &quot; I was very angry , and I was a very angry , ▁astronom .
I had to land . He was a writer .
So I &apos;m going to think about this .
( Music ) We &apos;re going to see 13 billion light to the edge of the universe , from the edge of the universe .
It may be dismissed , but it &apos;s the nearest fourth number .
And I discovered that I &apos;m going to make it warm , so I &apos;m going to show you , I &apos;m going to show you a whole bit of you .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s not right ?
( Applause )
If you have a text machine in the 1980s in the 1980s , you had to be able to be able to publish it .
It was going to be the example of a text written in the Bible .
And the government knew all of my identity .
When we found a piece of paper , when we found a piece of paper , they knew that this idea was written .
And what we found in the West is that I was a big golfer , which was a big car .
We didn &apos;t say that there &apos;s no time in those countries .
But this day , in 2001 , every famous name of the world is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
This is the reality of our own today .
Nobody does this .
This is a way that our government is using us to be able to use our own citizens .
This problem is the first story of three great projects .
When we looked at the problems of those things , we see the online processes of the particular group .
These are the rules of the neurons , three major groups .
The first , the online team .
In this way , it &apos;s like ▁Qo ▁Qo ▁şəhərində .
And the press Hasbro are not very hard to understand why they &apos;re going to cook to the Israeli .
These guys are using money .
Very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very lucky .
Well , we &apos;ve seen people who are a million , a million , and we &apos;ve seen people who are industrialized .
This is called ▁V ▁T .
This is ▁Al ▁Go .
And that &apos;s what Stephen Hawking .
This is Tiananmen ▁S .
This is the Anderson and ▁T . And it &apos;s going to be the story .
These guys are using their actions , but they &apos;re doing it with the collective path , and we use it with the ▁qeyri , or we use it in our banks , or we &apos;re able to use these things like an international computer , or when we &apos;re looking at a ▁virus computer , they put our data into our data .
And two months ago , he was a National named named ▁Sam , who was in this picture in this picture , who was a friend named Charles ▁Ja , who was in this picture in Switzerland , and he had 14 million U.S. dollars in the case .
You don &apos;t know where Steve Klee is .
And I think that day , we &apos;re going to be able to be bold in the online space in the journey of the real world .
And it seems to be more worse , and it seems worse .
In the future , the girls will be a great experience .
The second big thing that I &apos;m doing is not enough enough to do that work .
And in the reason that we can see them , I can think about the reason that we see this work .
And the groups like Navigenics began to jump into space and online and online , and in the last year .
I &apos;ve heard two of my basic stem rules : these are arum German groups like this , like ▁A ▁qrup , and the main force , the government and governments .
Let &apos;s look at what happened in companies like Navigenics .
This is what governments are seeing when governments are in their own citizens .
It &apos;s a ▁S ert in Scotland — it was a little bit — it was it .
Over the last year , we were surrounded from our online online processes .
One is the whole system in the system , the whole system .
And I thought about this last week , I asked him about this , and I asked him about this , and I asked the government to believe that the Bible was a human death , and I said , &quot; &quot; I believe that the Bible was a human death .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , I believe it didn &apos;t believe .
How do the people die ?
It &apos;s the ▁onlayn online Islands .
They &apos;re ▁s ▁S .
What do they do with the hardware ?
If you have the web , you have the web , and you have to use this session , like you want to use Jackson encryption , like you want to use ▁S encryption .
We use a lot of us to use a lot of people or some kinds of services , but it &apos;s more famous in countries like Iran , like Iran , and they &apos;re more likely to use a lot more than the ▁xarici services , because they don &apos;t know that they can control the public government .
But this control is called ▁xarici .
They can change the page .
This was what the tar company was .
What is the Arab Spring , like the Arab Spring ?
In the 1700s , the ▁ of the ▁gizli , the ▁gizli of the ▁gizli police , they gave a lot of patents to see the building .
And by these papers , there was a kind of ▁fa , and there was a ▁fa company in the boat , and there was a lot of companies in the foothills of the government , and the government has been created in control of all the connections and software to protect all the connections of the community .
This is ▁28 ▁a in the United States .
You &apos;ll be here in the top of the company .
So the Western government allows them to allow their own citizens to control their citizens in control .
But Western governments are doing it .
For example , a few weeks ago , we called the government Foundation in Germany , which was a virus called the international government .
And what if you don &apos;t know if you can &apos;t die , you &apos;re listening to your phone .
Now , it &apos;s already happening .
You &apos;ll follow your web connection .
When the government is connected to your computer , they can control all the connections , and they know your online philosopher , listen to your online philosopher .
Many people talk about these things , which says , &quot; &quot; Yes , not a good job , but I &apos;m a citizen , but I &apos;m a citizen , but I &apos;m a citizen , but I &apos;m a citizen , but I &apos;m a citizen .
Why am I worried ?
I don &apos;t have any thing . &quot; &quot; But this is a lot of people .
( Music ) ( Applause )
It &apos;s not the answer .
It &apos;s not the choice between security and coercion .
It &apos;s the choice between the privacy and control .
And in 2016 , in this day , we believe that our government is in this day , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re supposed to have .
But what can we believe about the next 50 years after the next 50 years ?
And the question is , and the questions should have to worry to us 50 years .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you very much . &quot; &quot; Because I was in a couple of years .
And I said , &quot; &quot; This is the first month , I was at the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I was in the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I was in the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I was going to be in the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I was going to be in the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve been going to be in the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve been going to be in the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve been going to be in the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I was going to be in the &apos; 90s . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I was going to have a little bit of the day . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot;
My parents and my friends were there to listen to me .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re here . &quot; &quot; And my mother said , &quot; &quot; Wow , Leo , Leo . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Wow , John , Johnny .
( Laughter ) Imagine that you &apos;re going to be a ▁sü , and you can imagine that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be a ▁hə .
My father told me , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the lunch . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to do that .
I looked at my wife , because I didn &apos;t understand where the voice came from .
In a decade , I was listening to my voice , and I said , &quot; &quot; God , who &apos;s the sound of what I think is the sound of me ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; God , who &apos;s the voice of me ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; God , who &apos;s the voice of me ? &quot; &quot;
And then I realized that this is my self , and I was laughing .
And my father said , &quot; &quot; Yes , he &apos;s cute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , I want you to go to this journey .
And despite this journey , this journey is all about us .
I believe that we can be able to be a metaphor for our journey , and I want you to think about your journey .
My journey was in the 1960s , and when I saw the equivalent of two of the oil oil of two oil oil , it &apos;s time to expand the Gulf of ▁iki oil .
And I decided to use me so much that I decided to use a car plant .
This is a big thing for ▁C .
And this was a big thing to go in in Philadelphia , and it was a big thing to go in in the winter of the &apos; 60s , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter .
And I started to walk down , and I started to walk down , and they knew what happened .
They asked them , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to walk on the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to do that , right ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to do it , right ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to do it , right ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to do it . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to do it . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to do it . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to do it . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to do it . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re
&quot; &quot; You can do this to us , &quot; &quot; maybe they were true , I think , if I went down , people don &apos;t make me .
Because people are going to be in the sea of the sea .
And I talked to people about this .
I called my patriotism .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t use a car . &quot; &quot; My father said , &quot; &quot; Why did you have this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know about the environment .
They were living in Philadelphia .
I said my mother — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very stoked , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If you pray , I don &apos;t need to tell it . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; If you pray , you don &apos;t need to tell it .
So , I decided , I decided , I decided to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a lot of physicists , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I decided , I decided , but I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave the talk , but I &apos;m going to leave a day . &quot; &quot; I decided , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave a day , but I &apos;m going to give you a day . &quot; &quot; I decided , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave a day , but I &apos;m going to give you a day . &quot; &quot; I decided , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave a day . &quot; &quot; I decided , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave a day , but I &apos;m going to give you a day .
So I did this .
When we looked at the morning , I was talking about a season .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that this was a nice experiment for me because I started to listen to the first time .
And I forgot to think about me .
Because every time I was reading , I &apos;m going to listen to people , and when I listened to people , I would hear people want to talk about what they want to talk about .
And I remember them in my mind , and I was thinking about what I &apos;d like to talk about , and what I &apos;m going to do is talk about what I want to talk about .
And then .
So it &apos;s the end of the process .
And that day , I was really afraid .
And it was a gift for me because I found something that I learned in the years .
I had 27 years old , and I think I know everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So , I was coloring this for the next day , and then again , and that time , I mean , I &apos;m going to tell myself , I &apos;m going to go in a year , because I started to learn , and I wanted to learn that .
So , I was talking about a year , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I thought I &apos;ve learned some things as I learned some things .
But this is a week .
And I went to the middle of this year , and I was a writer , and I was also in Cambridge , and I was also trying to read the book of art and my everyday life .
And I thought , I need to get education .
In the UK , we went to Ladakh , and they had the hardware software in the environment .
It &apos;s about 30 miles away .
I went to the office , and what ? What ?
I &apos;ve shown the program on the room .
Oh , you want to read here ?
Right ?
We have special software for you . They did that .
And after two years , I was going to be able to be there .
My father came to me . He was ▁f .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Listen , my son , we &apos;re ▁f , but we can &apos;t do what it &apos;s going to do .
If you don &apos;t talk , you can &apos;t talk , you don &apos;t want to talk . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I started to go up and go back again .
I went to Ladakh , and I was going to go back to the street , and I was going to go from the street , and I was going to go back to the Sydney River , and I was going to go back to the Sydney River , and I was going to go back to the ▁Mo , and I went there .
And two years ago , I got to Randolph-Macon College , and I loved it .
It wasn &apos;t bad for two years .
( Laughter ) And it happened . I went to school two years in school , and they &apos;ve shown me a lot of help .
There are two stories in the Alhambra .
The first thing is that I had no money .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s going to be bad . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Go to a school .
You &apos;re going to go to South America , heh ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , ladies and lakes , South America , South America .
So I did this .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , John , John , John , you can use a book that I know , and you can use a movie of a student , and you can use a film in the book as a student .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , let me tell you about all of my professors .
And then it &apos;s easy to be easy to be able to be able to be able to be easy , and then you don &apos;t have to be able to make it wrong , and then you don &apos;t eat it . &quot; &quot; All right ! Usually they don &apos;t know that the kid &apos;s in the ideal .
It was great to help me to help me .
They thought that my work was so much , and they tried to help me , and they tried to help me to help me .
And in this time , I went out to talk about the lessons that I was talking about .
The first time I went to school , I had 13 students .
And I wrote my friend in my friend , and I wrote my friend , John ▁F , and I said , &quot; &quot; John ▁F , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s the last lesson .
And all of the students who are in the workplace .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;ve seen the time that they &apos;ve been able to do it again .
And I realized that , and I realized that .
After two weeks , everybody tried to go back to the classroom .
And I learned a lot of things in this journey — this kind of thing .
People were looking at what John &apos;s going to do — I don &apos;t know what John &apos;s going to show — I don &apos;t know , you know , it &apos;s the enemy .
No , no . That &apos;s not that — it &apos;s used to be used .
You don &apos;t want to do it .
You can &apos;t pay your hands .
No , he said , &quot; &quot; No , he &apos;s talking about the ▁m .
So , this was the interview of this question , and we were talking about the question .
I went back to this work , and I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
But what I learned was something that I learned , and when we &apos;ve shown a sign , they felt that I didn &apos;t know that I didn &apos;t know that I didn &apos;t know .
And I thought , if you &apos;re a teacher and you don &apos;t learn , you don &apos;t learn if you don &apos;t learn it .
So I went up .
When I looked at my father , and I looked at my father , and my father told me , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ▁f , but you know , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to go and tell you , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to go and talk to me .
What do you do with the toy customer ? &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t know , and I went to London , and I went to London , and I went to London .
I was there two years , and I was there two years .
Nobody was interested with oil .
But something happened — ▁E ▁V .
And I was a man who wrote about the oil of oil in the United States .
My father came up .
He said , &quot; &quot; My son doesn &apos;t understand how they &apos;re doing this . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t want to talk .
And I said , &quot; &quot; We need to hate you , because you &apos;re going to do better things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I started to hit my head again .
I went to the northeast coast , and I went back to the northeast coast of the United States , and I had to have a day for seven years and a day .
And in 1990 , I started to go back to the last 20 years of the Earth .
And so I &apos;ve been able to use this season because it &apos;s not a man who &apos;s talking to them , if you don &apos;t know it , it &apos;s not sound .
And I didn &apos;t thank my family and my family because they didn &apos;t hear me .
And that &apos;s how it works .
And they asked me to listen to me — they didn &apos;t listen to me .
And that &apos;s something that &apos;s happening — and that &apos;s something that &apos;s happening .
It &apos;s really important — we need to listen to each other .
My journey came up .
My father told me , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the lunch . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t get it yet .
I was working in the Barefoot College , I was the Director of the U.N. .
I wrote the rules for the U.S. — which is the law of oil .
20 years ago , if somebody told me , &quot; John , do you want to make a difference ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I want to do different . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You start to go back to the northeast and go to the northeast . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , honey . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , honey . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) My friend , you want to get different .
How do this happen ? What ?
How do you make a difference with simple things like you want to go on and talk about simple things ?
It was great .
And after this — I &apos;ve done a year — I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve done a year to see this work , &quot; &quot; and I went to the Gulf of Manhattan , and I went back to the Gulf of Manhattan .
The key thing was , I &apos;d like to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you .
And I started talking to me , and I was aware of the environment .
I &apos;ve been aware of the environment — I was aware of the dynamic , but it was evolved .
And we &apos;ve learned about our own — I &apos;ve learned about people , and what do we do , and what we &apos;re doing ?
And it &apos;s not only trees and birds , not only of trees and birds , not only of the species , but in all kinds of species .
And if we grow around our environment , we all have to look at ourselves and see each other and each other .
And this was the message I want to leave .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sitting in my head , and I was going to go back to her , and I was working on her , and I was working on her — and I started to go back .
I &apos;m a story of this story , and I realized I was going to be able to use the car .
When I went through the beach — this was an extraordinary prison city , and I didn &apos;t know what he was , and I didn &apos;t know what he was , because I didn &apos;t know what happened because I didn &apos;t know what I didn &apos;t know because I didn &apos;t know what I didn &apos;t know because I didn &apos;t know what I was .
And I had a violin , and he said , &quot; &quot; e , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; e , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; e , &quot; &quot; and he was ▁t .
I said , &quot; &quot; Did you pray ?
I don &apos;t have to show you , I don &apos;t have to show you .
I went around the world and I went around the world , and I left it .
What did I do ?
It turned out .
They didn &apos;t smile me .
And I was angry , and I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m my enemy , and what am I doing ?
After 150 kilometers , I realized that I was sorry , and I was angry .
I was in prison , and I had to go there .
I was the prison that I was in my field , and I was a prison .
How does it happen ?
And when I started the side of the side , I didn &apos;t know if I started to use the car .
But it was the difference that I didn &apos;t have my own day , but I never wanted to use my own legs .
I didn &apos;t know that I &apos;m going to be the U.N. .
I didn &apos;t want to be a professor .
And so I realized that I just have another responsibility of my self , and I was not going to change it .
You know , we can do it .
I had to change .
And I didn &apos;t know , because I didn &apos;t know that I &apos;ve been able to dive up .
Because I spent my family to do the last thing .
I didn &apos;t know who I was .
But I didn &apos;t want to do that .
I didn &apos;t know , because this is where I &apos;m here today .
And I know that we have a place that we want to survive , but there are other places to go to us , but there are other places to go to us .
And we have to go to where we have our new self , and we have to go to where we have our new self .
And I &apos;d like to try you to start to go to where you &apos;re going to go to where you &apos;re in the street — where you &apos;re in the street , and it &apos;s hard to say , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to do something in this road . &quot; &quot; This day , we &apos;re going to do something in this road .
We need to stop .
As we said , &quot; &quot; We have to be ▁f , as we said , &quot; &quot; as we said , &quot; &quot; Well , we have to go .
And if my voice is changing you , if I think I live in my life , if I think I &apos;m here , if I &apos;m here , I want you to imagine that I &apos;m here .
I know , when I &apos;m here here , you can calculate me .
Let &apos;s go to the world — this is a little bit of love , and let &apos;s take this respect to us — we can create the world that we &apos;ve shown in TED , and we can create the world that we &apos;ve shown with each other .
Because we &apos;re losing our environment , and our ability to communicate ourselves is our ability to change our own environment .
So I &apos;m grateful to you , and I &apos;m going to finish my talk here , and I &apos;d like to end here with five seconds .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you might say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , if you sleep in a city every single city in America and ask you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , what is this pattern ? &quot; &quot; And you know , what is the instrument of this pattern ?
And you ask you , &quot; &quot; This is a restaurant , that &apos;s the river .
This is two 6- , this is two . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s called this filter ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s called the structure ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not called the structure .
They have the names of the streets , it &apos;s just a lot of ▁blok houses , and it &apos;s just a little bit like you , and it &apos;s a little bit like you .
Now , I think you can imagine that if you go to the middle of the moon , you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Sorry , what is this vacation ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , what is this old vacation ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , what is this old vacation ? &quot; &quot;
And he says , &quot; &quot; This is a prototype , and the size of this structure is 16 . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the old thing ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the old thing ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the old thing ?
They have names .
Look at Google . This is 14 , 15 , 16 , 16 , 18 blocks .
They have the names of all these blocks . They have a lot of minerals in the streets .
And you ask you , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you define your home ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is a ▁səkkiz ▁R .
This is a plastic and a house of the house , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Of course , they &apos;re going to go . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Of course , they &apos;re going to go .
The first home of the house is a third of the first home .
And then the second one of the second of the building is two .
This is still . It &apos;s so precise . &quot; &quot; And sometimes , I love that , and I love it to see that we never can &apos;t understand what we &apos;re capable of , and we &apos;re going to go to the side of the world .
For example , the doctors who are in China think that they &apos;re responsible for you .
And in the month you &apos;re not going to pay money , and if you &apos;re sick , you don &apos;t have any money if you &apos;re sick , because they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do . They don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do .
( Applause ) In many music , we &apos;re going to go back to a keyhole . One , two , three , three .
But the Western African music shows the face of music , like the point of a sentence .
So , it &apos;s not just if you can &apos;t see it , but you can see that it &apos;s two , three , four , four .
And this map is true .
And I think that &apos;s one of the things that you know about India , what you know about India .
So we never don &apos;t forget , or how you have great ideas in TED or elsewhere , or if you hear , it can be true .
