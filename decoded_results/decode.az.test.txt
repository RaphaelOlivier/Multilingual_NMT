I &apos;m going to talk about the unexpected discoveries today .
I &apos;m now working on solar technology .
And my little step point is to go to the middle of the circle , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
It &apos;s going to take a different amount of resources for this .
This is just a little video about what we do .
It &apos;s a minute .
It can take a little bit of time .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re just — let &apos;s take this piece — I &apos;m not going to go from the image of the video . ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter )
( Music ) That &apos;s not . ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The solar technology is the technology .
Oh , I &apos;m born ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
So I want to get attention to what you can see .
And after a few minutes , we &apos;re going to be able to do this . I hope that if you don &apos;t care less than your body , that can change your life dramatically .
We &apos;re very interested with the language language , especially that makes us care about the brain language .
<unk> are interested with us : ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a very simple thing , and it &apos;s a simple view , or whether it &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> , or even your hand .
Chef : So they &apos;re going to go to 10 percent home .
This lucky police is dense in the United States .
And then it &apos;s the head . No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re going to do it . We save ourselves .
It &apos;s <unk> .
We &apos;re trying to be invisible for the man in our head .
As you can see , again , both animals and people are the same things .
It turns out that it comes into the middle of this image .
We tend to get to the power of the people , and we tend to look at a little bit of the ones that we don &apos;t know .
And so , if you can do who we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re trying to try to learn , and we don &apos;t do it . We don &apos;t do it .
By the way , we don &apos;t listen to her power .
Do you know what I found ?
My name is that the MBA students are based on a lot of <unk> programs .
Some of them are living as leaders as leaders , and when they go to the room , they get to the corner of the mountain , and they &apos;re where they don &apos;t start to learn .
They &apos;re just going to look at two people in the world .
They give their hands in this form .
They &apos;re just the invisible world .
They &apos;re writers like sitting , and they do their hands in this form .
I &apos;ve been a couple of results for myself .
The first one is that it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
It turns out that it &apos;s happening with this species .
So women don &apos;t know more than men more than men .
Women don &apos;t even feel more vulnerable than men , and it &apos;s not surprising .
And it &apos;s not a successful thing .
And this is very important for the MBA students , because they affect their students to price .
Our business schools are always fighting .
The person who &apos;s going to work in the same , and women have been different at the end of the time , and it turns out that it &apos;s connected with this .
And I started thinking about myself , which is that they &apos;re more active in the classroom , and they &apos;re more active in the classroom .
If we show these videos , we want to look at them in this kind of way , and I &apos;m going to be more active in the lesson ?
He didn &apos;t have to be real .
So if we make a long period of time , can we feel more powerful in the behavior of the behavior ?
And we know that we have a little bit of a little bit of thinking about our automated research and our minds , and that &apos;s a lot of analogies .
But the question that makes us really interested with us is that these crazy trials and technicians don &apos;t affect ourselves .
But we &apos;re also going to take the pen through our teeth , and we need to be laughing .
So this is every two languages .
It &apos;s also in the problem of the problem .
We tend to tend to be strong and sure that we &apos;re strong and confident , but when we &apos;re trying to become strong , we feel powerful .
And as we know , we don &apos;t change our understanding of our thoughts , not changing our thoughts .
What do I talk about when you think about a matter of value , in terms of the notion of the problem ?
I &apos;m talking about ideas and feelings , and I &apos;m talking about the mythology of the physiology that are spreading them , and I &apos;m looking at the <unk> .
What is it that &apos;s important to be aware of the benefits of the poor ?
It &apos;s not a <unk> , because they don &apos;t have strong people .
They call them two minutes .
And we &apos;re proposing them .
They chose to play the <unk> game .
It &apos;s about 60 percent , but it &apos;s 60 percent . This is a very important difference .
So this is what we found in the test .
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the interest that we &apos;ve been dealing with in the past of the study , and in other parts , it has 10 percent of the time .
Adam will be able to be able to get these changes to two minutes .
This is what &apos;s happening in the horizon .
It &apos;s about 25 percent of the <unk> in the middle of the Cold War , at least 15 percent .
Adam twice makes these <unk> changes , and the brain allows us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to feel more intuitive and comfortable and comfortable .
These feelings are all met us , right ?
So the body is the way we think about ourselves , and we can understand how to feel , so pheromones are not alone for others .
It changes the way we can see other aspects of it .
The next question that worries us is that we want to change a few minutes of power to change our lives .
This is two minutes in this format .
What can we do in real life ?
Of course , that &apos;s what &apos;s really interesting to us .
In our case , these tiles can be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Where are it happening ?
It &apos;s a <unk> table for new subjects .
For some of them , they &apos;re going to collect this school .
It &apos;s a solution for some of them , or it &apos;s a business interview .
And we thought that many of you are interested in a job of labor , because you have this experiment .
So we published our findings , and the media gave them large , and that &apos;s what sociologists say : &quot; &quot; What do we do when we go to work ?
( Laughter ) And of course , we &apos;ve got this idea . No ! Of course , no ! We didn &apos;t know that .
You can &apos;t do that !
This is not just you with others .
It &apos;s for your communication .
What do you do before you start to speak ?
You &apos;re sitting . You look at your body and your cheese .
As you look at the dragonflies , you &apos;re going to take it down , you &apos;ve got it , you &apos;ve got it , and what you &apos;re going to do is , this is what you &apos;re going to do . It &apos;s like you sit on the moon . Two minutes , you sit .
That was what we want to keep .
And they &apos;ve spent a lot of time in a very late business interview , and after they met the <unk> and the lack of resilience , they &apos;ve been in a very late business interview .
Five minutes were taken on video video .
They were taught to use the information of the people who have been able to prevent the value of the people who were able to prevent the value of the people . They looked like this .
Five minutes ago , it &apos;s more likely to look at the <unk> .
Nobody likes that .
Mark <unk> says that , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t stand in the <unk> bar . &quot; &quot; This is the <unk> level in human beings .
We took them from a interview to see these things .
And then we showed them four of these structures .
They were unaware of their expectations .
He didn &apos;t know who he did . After the body <unk> , he said , &quot; &quot; We want to take these things together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want to take them together .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to do these things .
And they &apos;re more <unk> . &quot; &quot; What does it affect ?
This is not the story of their story .
It &apos;s about what they &apos;re looking at with their own stories .
We were looking at other features of them . For example , what is it so easy to talk about ?
Why do they have advantage ?
There was no difference .
That wasn &apos;t what you see the key effect .
People are only coming out of real parts .
So they were able to follow them .
They &apos;ve never been aware of their ideas , they &apos;re all affected .
It makes this difference .
And I tell people that we can change our thoughts , our sense of thinking , our behavior , and we say , &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t that a little bit of simplicity ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t that a little bit of simplicity ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a little bit of simplicity ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a little bit of simplicity ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a little bit of simplicity ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a little bit of simplicity ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a little bit of simplicity ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t that a little bit ?
I &apos;m going to make a lot of friction until you get to the truth .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not that .
I don &apos;t want to do it , and I don &apos;t want to feel <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to be angry .
I don &apos;t want to be in my own .
I &apos;ve been doing these words very well . I want to tell you a little story about the feeling of feeling , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not my place . &quot; &quot; I want to tell you a little story about the feeling of feeling .
When I was 19 , I had a very heavy car accident .
It was taken into the desert .
I got a couple of times together .
I was looking at the prison ceremony , and I was going to leave the college , and I came back to the college , and I came down to two <unk> , and it was very painful for me .
I was <unk> , because I felt like I was a smart and loving kid .
I wanted to go back to the school , and I wanted to go back .
They said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to finish the room .
It &apos;s what you can do , but it &apos;s not the college . &quot; &quot; And I started to deal with this , and I &apos;m going to argue that your most important feature you have , you can &apos;t be able to do anything like your hand .
I felt very weak .
I worked , I worked , and I was working , and I &apos;ve been successful .
I finished the college .
I had to spend four years from my brother , and I was a <unk> <unk> , and I decided to meet me in Princeton University , so I said , &quot; &quot; Where I &apos;m not . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Where I &apos;m not . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Where I &apos;m not . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Where I &apos;m not . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Where I &apos;m not . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Where I &apos;m not . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Where I &apos;m not . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Where I &apos;m not .
I was <unk> .
In Princeton , 20 minutes ago , 20 minutes ago , I &apos;ve been talking about 20 minutes .
It was night .
I was so afraid that the morning would go to the morning , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re not going to .
He says , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t go and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , you can &apos;t go and say , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to go and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you can &apos;t go and say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to go and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you can &apos;t go and say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You can
Even though it &apos;s in cinema .
You &apos;re going to do all the steps that you have to do .
Again , again , if you &apos;re afraid , and you &apos;re afraid , you know , if you hear your body , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m finished . I &apos;m sorry !
I mean , you &apos;re going to work until you &apos;re going to work . &quot; &quot; And I did that .
I &apos;m listening to five years of school school . A few years ago , I &apos;ve been working in the magazine , I &apos;m working there , and I &apos;m working there . I don &apos;t think about that , but I thought , &quot; &quot; This is not my place .
At the end of the last year I was in the literature , he said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to be in the Tube , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; You should be in the <unk> , or you &apos;ll be . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know it .
And he was sitting up , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not my place .
This was the transition for me .
Because two things were done .
The first thing I realized is that I don &apos;t have this feeling .
But he felt , and he was met to me .
Secondly , I realized that he was right .
So , he could be able to do it .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re right here !
He &apos;s going to show him the best description of the morning , and I said , &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) I said , &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) I said , &quot; &quot; You can put it in the room as well as today . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the room today . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , he didn &apos;t sit there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A few months later , he came back to me , and I saw him , not until he was real , but I saw it until he was real .
He was born .
And I &apos;d like to tell you , I want to tell you .
Take a lot of friction .
Let &apos;s show you if you have someone who doesn &apos;t want to be .
You don &apos;t want to talk about it .
It can make a huge difference .
Now , two minutes ago .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
Now , before you get a piece of stone , two minutes ago , you try to do it , try to do it . In Lebanon , in the room room , the table is on the table , or the right door on the door .
Let &apos;s try to do it .
<unk> your government to be the best .
Add our research . It &apos;s not going to increase the pancreas .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to show them what I could be possible . &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Well , I would show them what I &apos;m going to be . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I would show them what I &apos;m going to be possible .
You see , &quot; &quot; I knew who I am , and I didn &apos;t know who I am ! &quot; &quot; You &apos;re looking at the shape .
And if you can put these forces out of these forces , I &apos;d like to leave him with other others , and it &apos;s very simple to say that it &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s not a <unk> . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s the people that are going to be able to get out of the outcome , and the people who can benefit with people are people who don &apos;t have to benefit with technology , and the people who don &apos;t have to contribute to it .
They can &apos;t be able to use it with them .
They can be able to be able to make two minutes of their body to make two minutes in their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have a lot of haters in the world .
The worst of them is invisible .
It &apos;s like the <unk> , and they &apos;re the ones who get <unk> materials to live .
It turns out that it has been made from the number of parts of the system that had been found from the power of the system .
<unk> are making a system that makes all everybody benefit , and they create a system , but they don &apos;t thank them .
Here , in the Galapagos , it &apos;s 90 percent of the money that will be <unk> — they &apos;re collecting them .
Most of the guards are connected . They took them out of the streets , and they &apos;ve been able to go to the <unk> level .
<unk> are in a couple of places in a couple of places , and they &apos;re looking at the <unk> and the <unk> , and it reminds you that they &apos;re going to be <unk> , or the city of the city .
And this was why I met these <unk> articles .
I &apos;m a <unk> artist , and I &apos;m obsessed , and it &apos;s about social , politics and environmental environmental issues .
In 2007 , I went to the city of the city , and I put my work from the walls of the walls .
But this time , it &apos;s going to be the <unk> .
My work took a lot more attention to my work , and it helped them get a lot more attention to their work , and they helped them get their confidence to the level of their confidence .
These days , they &apos;re famous in the press and social media .
And it turns out that since I met this world , I &apos;ve been doing this in this area .
In many cities , I had a lot of <unk> , and I was invited to a lot of titles and journeys in the world .
And I found that they &apos;re not just going to be in the <unk> , but they &apos;re not just going to <unk> .
I was in the developing countries in the country , in the east , South Africa , in South Africa , even in Europe and the United States .
After that , I realized that there should be more people in this issue , because it was big work .
After that , I created a movement under &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) — it &apos;s a <unk> movement .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; was a huge challenge that was created with the foundation of the <unk> and the yetis .
They were used to be used , <unk> , <unk> , hair tourists , singers and <unk> officers , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do by the medical services and the health services .
In fact , when the crabs were being taken by our girls , they would be able to see their security clothes to see the <unk> and the city to see the <unk> and the city .
They &apos;ve taken other masterpieces for compassion : <unk> , <unk> and mirrors .
And finally , they would be part of the great and big <unk> of this great and big breakthrough .
&quot; &quot; The <unk> is great , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
But let &apos;s be inspired for the <unk> of the city who was in the <unk> , and we created a PC called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was designed by &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;ve created an email called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
So everybody would be able to participate .
In two years , <unk> , <unk> , and 200 to 200 artists , and it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the local school , even in the local school .
They would be able to be able to be able to be able to be aware of the <unk> and the value of the <unk> .
They knew that they had a lot of people who were used to their extraordinary <unk> , and they were able to increase their relationships with their revenues and community .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you , you know , the cathedrals and other invisible actors in your cities , and I &apos;m calling them to recognize them .
You &apos;re trying to see a whole way without the edges and the <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t be a genius , there are more than 20 million hectares in the world .
And when you see someone , I &apos;ve known them as a part of our society .
<unk> <unk> , thank you .
( Applause )
Five , 20 , in the 19th century , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was in Manhattan in Manhattan — <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It was known to be known by the <unk> , but when we put the light on the speed of light , another of the other women who were in the middle of New York , they &apos;ve been able to share the tools in New York City , and they were able to share my body programs in the end of the United York City .
The unexpected plans were <unk> by the FDA .
But sadly , in 1991 , the World Trade Center didn &apos;t have been illegal .
At the end of the last , the <unk> <unk> was known .
<unk> <unk> is my father .
In 1989 , I put the world back to the world as a child of <unk> engineers and <unk> , and I &apos;ve been able to look at the world as a child , and I had a lot of people who were going to get me in a happy age .
After my age , when I was in my family , we started to change the lives of our family .
My father was inspired to see that Islam has seen a lot of people who have seen a lot of people in a lot of Muslims .
And I learned this from my life experience : people don &apos;t have a long time to understand that every single one of us is the same , and it doesn &apos;t take long time to understand that each of us is the same .
In every religion , it will be less likely to be less likely to be able to be less likely to be able to be able to get them in every single mile , and they &apos;re going to be less likely to get them to their own lives .
After a few months ago , my father was reminded to me , &quot; &quot; When I had a couple of weeks ago , I had to take my father in New York , with a couple of weeks of friends .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , the morning said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go home with him .
We went to the <unk> <unk> <unk> . We didn &apos;t know that the FDA was in the secret of the FDA .
When I got to me , my father helped me hold me in my basement , and he agreed how to address 30 meters .
The last laugh that I took from the day came to a little orange box on the floor , and it was <unk> , and everybody was surprised , especially I am .
My brother said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
Well , it &apos;s all like that , but after a few years , I realized they were really loved .
They were thinking that my father could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see what my father could be .
At the end of the last , these people were known to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get six people from
And these people , I &apos;ve taken my mind , and I was going to do it , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of time . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of time . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to give you a lot of people . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to give you a lot of people . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to give
I said , &quot; &quot; My name was people .
As I was 19 years old , we were born for 20 times , and when I was in the age of my life , it was the reason that my friends were less likely to be less .
It would be one of the things that I felt very close to myself , and I was going to go to other cities .
As a new one , I &apos;ve always been obsessed by the future of the child .
I didn &apos;t have my career in my class to be in the middle of my class , but it was just obvious that the new school of the new school was the most <unk> and the topography of the new school .
So I sent a lot of my time to read books , television and play .
And so , in this case , I had to have a lot of life in social communication , and I had to be able to be ready to live with life as a teenager , as a teenager .
I grew up in a place where people are considered a race and religion .
What did it mean ?
One of my first experiments from this kind of idea of thinking about this kind of concept was the election of the year 2000 .
I had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
And the group that I was in , the group of young people , had been diagnosed with young men , and as one of the people who had a lot of a member of life , I didn &apos;t have to be able to do it .
It was the people that were in a different way of life .
I learned that I was in the last day in the past day , and I learned that one of my children was Jewish .
This is what happened for a few days , but I found that I was not the enemy that I had to be exposed to both of us .
I was not a Jewish friend , and I was a proud feeling for my life to convince me that my life was not supposed to be in my life .
And it turns out that there was a lot more important to get a little bit more important in the summer of the summer .
I was part of the people who have different faith and cultures , and this experiment was the fundamental role of the self .
I was taught that the great part of my life has a huge effect of compassion and all the clothes that were all gay .
And it turns out that in the audience , I had a chance to work with professional art , and in the way , I think they &apos;re the most likely people that I &apos;ve seen as a lot of the most likely people that I &apos;ve ever seen .
I found it . I found a lot of people like someone who &apos;s a lot of people like one of them , and I feel that I &apos;m going to give me a joke that I don &apos;t care about , and I don &apos;t like to give me a little bit of a <unk> .
And I &apos;ve been able to compare me to the real experience of a moral experience that I wanted to talk to me about .
I don &apos;t know how to do it , but I &apos;ve met a lot of good , but I &apos;ve met a lot of good people who don &apos;t listen to you .
And then , then , I had the &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; So I was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to express me with my privilege of my privilege , and the race of the person , the religious and the religious and the sexual doctrine of the man , helped me realize that he wasn &apos;t in the way .
So , the photographer <unk> , as I was talking about the time I needed to vote , was the opposite of me .
First of the first time , I had a lot of <unk> , and my former hometown of college was the fact that I was able to show my view of the world that I could show my father even more powerful effects than my father .
One day day , I was talking about my mother &apos;s view of the world , and my mother told me that I didn &apos;t have to have a lot of tears .
My mother looked at me as one of my rescuers who lived in my life , and he said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t hate people . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t hate people .
I realized how much negative energy I had to do in a moment .
My mind is not the real step .
I changed my parents with my father , and when I decided to start a new life , I changed it .
So why did I fight myself ?
The answer is very simple .
And I hope that , maybe , I hope that I &apos;ve never heard my story with my story , and I realized that there is a better way to be , and I didn &apos;t even have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have
Instead , I chose to use my career experience as the challenge of my life and my vagina .
I &apos;m going to give this horrible pain and mistakes that they &apos;re born with , and their bees , and their bees .
I &apos;m going to leave my father &apos;s hand from the victims of my father who was not born in this kind of violence , and I &apos;m going to leave my father .
As a simple example of my friends , I &apos;m not going to have a living amount of life , and I &apos;m not supposed to go to the way that the woman is going to go to the road and the way that the woman is not supposed to go with the way .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Your morning is good !
Tamara ?
They took a walk on them , but I wanted to ask you to ask you , who was in Arabic in the age of the house ?
Anyone wrote ? Who is it ? Okay , no problem .
One day ago , I was a writer , and I got my wife with my friend and my wife .
And I looked at the office , and I said , &quot; &quot; Do you have it ?
He looks strange to me when I thought he &apos;s wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t forget ? ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Wow , no . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; What would you say to him ? &quot; &quot; I know . &quot; &quot; I know .
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! He calls it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; ?
He said , &quot; &quot; The future , you &apos;re going to be doing this ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Come . &quot;
He &apos;s <unk> from me , and he said , &quot; &quot; If you were the ultimate girl in this world , I wouldn &apos;t look at him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
What does you mean from the Arabic of &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is known in Arabic ?
Adam 2 , who was a young boy , he was in the back of the girl , and he was <unk> .
So , how do it look like this ?
Now , I started thinking .
It was called me .
This is really <unk> .
They don &apos;t know that I &apos;m talking about my own country in my own country .
Where do this happen ?
How do we celebrate here ?
But we have a lot of men here who have a lot of men here , and they &apos;re moving into a stage in their own lives , and they have all of the things that they &apos;ve been talking about as well as they &apos;re modern and cultural .
I &apos;m not afraid of my whole culture , ideas , thoughts and experience ?
The old experience of leadership could be our best experience !
I &apos;m not just aware of everything I learned in Arabic .
Do I forget to be one of them ?
Did it be possible here ?
But despite all of these , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to help me .
The Arab language doesn &apos;t answer that day .
It &apos;s not the language of science , but it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re accustomed to in universities , but it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re using in our universities , and that &apos;s not the language that we use in the air .
If we &apos;ve chosen this , they were our clothes .
What do I have to use with my language ? We all need to ask !
You know , we use Arabic . Are we using it ?
It &apos;s a reality .
But there &apos;s another sense that we &apos;re thinking about .
Arabic language is the role of Arabic .
In the study , if you have to be perfect in the center of the other language , you have to be perfect .
It &apos;s fair to know that authenticity is the ability to express ideas in creative ways .
What is it ?
And when <unk> Clinton started writing the first time , he used to use Arabic .
He was transferred from a little boy in the village , and his dreams and the philosophy of the scientist , a special voice .
So when he started writing this English in English , he had enough <unk> .
In fact , when you read her writing in English , you feel that you feel your own smell , and you get the feeling .
You know , what you can imagine is that he wrote English in English , and he &apos;s a boy from the mountain mountains .
This is an example that &apos;s not a definition of definition .
Secondly , it turns out that if you want to kill a mile , the only way to kill a mile is to kill her .
This is a reality that we have developed society .
Germans , <unk> , butterflies — this country is aware of this conflict .
And so they are the law of their own language .
They &apos;re <unk> it .
And so they use a lot of money to develop language , to improve language .
Do we know more than them ?
Well , we don &apos;t know that we don &apos;t know that we don &apos;t know the world , and we didn &apos;t want to live with the cultural world .
It &apos;s like ours , but it was a science for development , but they were going to go back to the countries , and they were going to go to the countries like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and they were protected with them as they don &apos;t get it .
They looked at their language close .
Because if you take a product , or another side of a place , and if you don &apos;t have the hashtag in the radio , it doesn &apos;t mean , it &apos;s not the local product .
You couldn &apos;t believe that it was a local product .
They would be lucky , as we &apos;ve been in a long time , as we &apos;re in a long time .
So they had to protect their own language to innovate and produce .
If I say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; is going to remember you ?
Don &apos;t remember what you &apos;re saying , right ?
It &apos;s not what it &apos;s like and why it &apos;s not .
The language is not just the way that the words of our mouth come from , not the way to speak .
The language is a very specific step in our lives , and it &apos;s based on our fears that are connected to our fears .
So , when we say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; when you say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; they have special images in the sense of each one of you , and they have special history , private history .
It &apos;s not a language , two or three words or three words .
It &apos;s the idea of how we think , how we see each other , how we see each other .
What is the innovation ?
How do you say , that &apos;s human growth , right ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; and if you say , &quot; Dad , you &apos;re older ? &quot;
What does you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , it &apos;s good , I &apos;m going to go and talk to the empty places .
And that &apos;s what happens to us , which is a special thing to us .
I have a friend of mine who &apos;s married with a writer .
I said , &quot; &quot; How do they go ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is good . But I worked for a day for him to shape &quot; &quot; <unk> for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , women are the wrong &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , the woman said to him , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then he &apos;s trying to tell him the word .
He said , &quot; &quot; How do humanity be so painful ?
Do he want to sacrifice ?
&quot; Excuse me ? ( Laughter ) &quot; This is one of a few examples .
And we started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , the woman doesn &apos;t tell him the word , and women can &apos;t call him the word . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true to be able to deal . It &apos;s different .
My friend said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; and I tried to translate my friend for him , and I tried to put it for him , and I feel that I feel like I hear the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the woman tried to describe this for him : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got my hands back , and I hated you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s the problem : &quot; &quot; Well , I took my hands back , and I left you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s the problem : &quot; &quot; If you were to say , I took my hands back , and I left you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s the problem : &quot; &quot; Well , I took my hands back , and I left you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s the problem : &quot; &quot; If you were to say , I took my hands back , and I left you . &quot; &quot; (
Take this for me .
( Applause ) What did we do to protect Arabic ?
We &apos;ve been able to turn it into the story of the American society , and we &apos;re starting to fight the Arab state .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Why are you going to worry ?
It &apos;s fun for him and it &apos;s fun for itself . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no problem !
And this was the <unk> of the Arab War , which is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about the East , you &apos;ll answer me from the West . &quot; &quot;
We said , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t know it , and we don &apos;t know it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose this way , because we didn &apos;t know that way .
And if someone talks about me , I hate Arabic .
We say , ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and we can change our dreams , our desires and our daily life .
We &apos;re wearing it like us , and we &apos;re going to take the way you think like us .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about the East , but you &apos;ll answer me from the West . &quot; &quot; It was a <unk> .
Very simple , same time , creative and <unk> .
After that , we started to have another campaign written in the ground .
If you saw this example , you see the language of black and yellow , and he says , &quot; Don &apos;t kill your tongue ! &quot;
Why ? In fact , I kill it .
We have to kill the language of the Bible .
If we had to kill the language , we would be able to be able to know .
We had to find our existence .
We had to go back to the beginning .
It &apos;s serious to lose our chance to be modern and cultural .
After that , we &apos;ve spread the old men and girls and girls .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is the images of girls and boys .
We &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
And who said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;re going to call English ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; But let me tell me a better question , but let me tell me a better word , let &apos;s make the reality better .
I &apos;m going to go back to &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m looking at the world of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it doesn &apos;t work ! We need to do it .
But as we &apos;re going to this point , we need to say that if we &apos;re a language language , we have to tell us that we are bigger and bigger , and we think that we want to go and think that we want to do our own lives , and you can feel that they want to do them .
It &apos;s the idea .
If we can &apos;t fly into the universe , and we can &apos;t make the rocket , and we can be creative .
You know , every one of you is a creative project .
It &apos;s a direct way of creativity in the mainstream .
Let &apos;s start this moment .
Let &apos;s just write a novel paper and a short film .
And a novel can make us global .
This is the Arabic situation , and that &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
It says , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no way to say . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not flat . There &apos;s the road .
But we need to know , and we need to be part of the road , and we have a part of the road .
You know , what can you do tonight ?
<unk> , who is <unk> ?
Even if I get my time , I &apos;d like you to thank you very much , or in Arabic , English , or <unk> .
But in Arabic , it &apos;s not written by the numbers of the numbers that are written in Arabic .
( Applause ) This is disaster ! This is not language !
You &apos;re going to be in the audience with a visual language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back to a place like this .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , there are many other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not collecting each other in this day to convince each other .
And we &apos;re here , and we &apos;re here to get the importance of this language to the center .
Now , I &apos;m a mystery angle .
You know , you know , the first time you can see your father &apos;s father in language .
When my daughter was born , I said , &quot; &quot; This is your ancestor , honey . ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; This is your ancestors , honey . &quot; &quot; And my daughter says , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re so good . &quot; &quot; And my daughter says , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re very good , &quot; &quot; and I don &apos;t know who I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I don &apos;t know who he didn &apos;t hear .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Let &apos;s take yourself from this cultural adventure . ( Applause )
For a few years ago , we &apos;ve been talking about the United States of the United States .
I learned a couple of things when I had these 30 days .
Instead of being able to get out of months , you &apos;ve got more eyes .
For example , I took a picture every day in a month .
And before I started to start 30 days ago , I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And I also learned that I &apos;m not going to do it .
By the way , the mystery of this is that the mystery of this is not the way to write the words .
But you &apos;re going to end up .
It &apos;s so bad .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a computer scientist .
No , if I want to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer .
And I learned that I didn &apos;t know that I could be a little bit of time , and I couldn &apos;t have a lot of time .
In fact , they &apos;re very fun .
( Applause )
The first day I started to college is the first day of hope and optimism .
And before I did the school , my expectations were high , and I started to work with the passionate experience of the sexual feeling , and I started to work with a group of students who were dealing with the rule of the road and the road .
And the student who had been able to do this was actually a great , energetic image , which was really prepared , and it was a <unk> image .
And I was afraid of the space that I felt like , I felt a lot of <unk> , insecure , <unk> , and I felt that I felt in my life .
But I didn &apos;t know that these fears are good .
<unk> <unk> was so frustrating that I didn &apos;t even know myself , and I knew that the first step was finished , and he couldn &apos;t predict it when it started to the second .
As I did , as I did , as I did , I got a little voice in my basement , and when I left the room , I got a little voice : &quot; &quot; Oh , she &apos;s leaving the room . &quot; &quot; And I was in love .
There was no homeless in the kitchen , and the illusion of the illusion that I was saying was the age of the illusion of uncertainty .
As a teenager , the book is taking books on the table .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s going to go . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I went .
This was a beginning .
And after days , after weeks , I &apos;ve talked about my wish to give me everything to me .
&quot; That &apos;s going to work . &quot;
<unk> , and even a while after a while , he felt like a friend and hope , but I also thought that this is the kind of feeling that I &apos;ve seen in a classroom that I &apos;ve seen in a classroom .
So for example , I &apos;m sorry that my brother and the real feeling of my brother and the real feeling was the voice .
At the time , I didn &apos;t really worry about me , but I felt that I felt that I was trying to work with my feelings that I was going to do , and I felt that I was trying to work with my fears .
I was told about my career , and he came to the horror .
And the scores that were exposed to this was the middle : normal people heard sound , and I was a serious honor to hear .
He started a little bit scared , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I went to the doctor . I went to a doctor . I sent my second mistake .
I &apos;m going to be able to go to a school doctor .
And what I found was that I saw the fear of my heart , and I saw that I was listening to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and as you tell me , he wrote the pen , and he came around .
Well , I needed this argument and help , and I started telling him about my <unk> .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t want to tell me , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell
I was obsessed in the lab , and it looks like it &apos;s a bad thing , and it looks like a bad thing that I said .
For example , I was like , &quot; &quot; I want to thank my students , &quot; &quot; I want to say , &quot; &quot; I want to go , I want to go .
I &apos;m going to have six or six years old . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And after that , it started to get out of the speed .
I &apos;ve been able to be able to go to the lab , and then he had <unk> <unk> , and then it was the worst : I had a sense of frustration and frustration and confusion .
The sound that I was saying was not a personal experience of life , but I was afraid that I was not sure that I was embarrassed , and I was not embarrassed .
It was a <unk> , a kind of psychological war , a kind of psychological war , and it started to get a lot of attention and angry and angry and angry .
I had taken my world in my world , and I was obsessed with a <unk> world , and my voice was also my <unk> .
For example , if I think that I was empowered to help them , they were able to change my life , and that strange , kind of kind of <unk> , a kind of <unk> .
All sorts of things , as we &apos;ve been able to be able to get three pounds before the puzzle , then it was more <unk> , and especially <unk> , like , &quot; &quot; Do you see the teacher ?
Do you see the water that is water ?
When I went home , I was in front of this water teacher , and that &apos;s obvious .
In the end , fear , <unk> , <unk> , and I didn &apos;t know that I felt deeply insecure , and I was able to create peace and shelter in this war .
Two years later , I was going to make it hurt .
And I was just aware of all of the girls : scary sounds , <unk> images , strange , bizarre images .
My uncle was a catalyst for the <unk> , the <unk> , the physical and the <unk> , and my therapist said , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s better than that . &quot; &quot; And he had <unk> , and the drugs were labeled , and it was a line of a line , and the notes were so <unk> , and I wanted to paint the point for them to be able to be bored .
Now , I think it &apos;s going to go to the world , and at the end of the fall , I think one person dies , a person dies .
He was sent to the corner and the corner of the corner , and it goes from this journey , and it &apos;s going to come back to a place that I have to go back to .
Most people have taken me out of me , and they &apos;re all looking at them , but these experiences were very weak and left for people who helped me .
I &apos;ve heard the other voice , and I &apos;ve been saved , and I &apos;ve never been able to get out of the soul , and I don &apos;t know how much I was going to go back to her , and the mother who was ready to go back to him , and the mother who was ready to wait for it , and the mother who was ready to wait for it , and I had a long time to wait with it , but in this time , I was in the worst time of my life in the worst time of my life , &quot; You don &apos;t get your hope . &quot;
I believe it &apos;s going to do that .
And sometimes , if it rains , it turns out that it &apos;s the opposite . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to thank me for 14 minutes , and for me , I &apos;m not going to thank these beautiful people to go back to me , and I &apos;m going to talk to these beautiful people .
But they were able to be able to make the courage to be the courage to be the courage to be the courage of their mind .
And I realized that I would be able to save me , and most of the time , I &apos;ve always met something that I had never been able to deal with , and I realized that I had to know something that I &apos;ve never met , and I realized that it was not the enemy , and it was not the enemy of the word , not the enemy .
Of course , it was hard to believe that the sounds of the sounds were in the enemy , and it was hard to believe that the first important step was that I was trying to figure out what I knew .
So for example , I learned to tell my home to the sound of my life — not like real and physical , but I felt that I felt like the fear and the moral feeling that I felt .
I believed to them .
In one night , when I read them in the door of my parents , I &apos;m looking at the instinct to protect them from the sounds that I &apos;m doing .
And for me , there was a lot of people in the house that had a lot of people in the house , and he was wearing a lot of people in the house , sitting in the room , sitting in the room , and it &apos;s a bad thing .
I mean , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t work with me .
Do you see it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And this was what I &apos;m looking at .
And then I was able to make my more important skill , as I was going on in the side of the word , and I &apos;ve been able to make my more important skill : I would thank them to know how much the way I felt , because you know how to do it , because you know how to do it , and I didn &apos;t know how to do it , so I didn &apos;t know how to do it , and I didn &apos;t know why I was going to be a reason for fear and fear .
I was going to take the notes down , and I started to answer them , but I started to communicate and communicate and collaborate to learn .
And I learned that all of these are all a voice , and I didn &apos;t have to solve , and I &apos;ve learned that I didn &apos;t have to solve the pain of violence , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and feeling .
The notes came into the world , and I discovered that the sound that was the most enemy and the <unk> , and the voice of the <unk> and the <unk> , I discovered that it was the noise that needs to be the most compassionate and <unk> .
And after he realized that , I realized that I had been stuck in the basement of the stadium , and I went back to the <unk> drugs , and then I moved back to the literature in the other role .
About 10 years after I heard the voice , I realized that in the history of college , in psychology , I was high , I graduated . One year later — I took the highest sanitary degree .
One of the notes is to me .
In fact , I get fun with each other .
As he said , he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to be able
We don &apos;t want to listen to two conversations in the same time .
And I worked in a medical school , and I &apos;ve been able to publish books and articles , and I &apos;m going to continue to do what the most important question is that the most important question is wrong .
When I heard the notes , I learned to live with them , and I learned that compassion is changing and respect and respect .
I remember that I could help others to help others who have been treated from the most extraordinary memory .
Now , I &apos;m proud of the University of <unk> , the International <unk> <unk> , and this is an attempt that led to the work of <unk> <unk> and Dr. <unk> and Dr. <unk> and Dr. <unk> and Dr. <unk> , but it feels like it &apos;s a hard , important , important , important , important , important , important , important , important , important thing .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the voices and understanding that they need to be able to be able to share the people who have heard the voices and understand them as a citizen , and they &apos;re not going to be able to solve them as a citizen .
This kind of particular society can be replaced , even in the ground .
There &apos;s a unique case of the horizon that it doesn &apos;t matter when social change is growing .
It &apos;s not going to leave the poor person .
It &apos;s not going to take people who don &apos;t afford .
To me , the notes are not just the definition of definition and respect , not only the words , but the fact that they can change the world and change the world .
In the last 20 years , I &apos;ve been raised by the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> countries , and I &apos;m going to work together , and we &apos;re going to work together , and we &apos;re going to be able to build the opportunities of people who have a sense of decency , <unk> and soul , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
As the <unk> <unk> said , it &apos;s a subjective sense that there &apos;s a spiritual spirit that has a spiritual spirit to use the human body .
This is the greatest thing for our society — to help the future of one of the things that needs to be right , to take your hand , to share your ego , to share it , to be right .
We have to live with adversity and humility , we need to live with you .
We &apos;re unique . We &apos;re going to do it .
It &apos;s not going to do what &apos;s happening in the Bible , and it &apos;s not going to be <unk> .
The work is the truth .
As a great doctor told me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about what others say .
Talk about it . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to talk about my vagina .
But that &apos;s the picture ?
Because , of course , this is not a picture of a picture of your camera .
However , my favorite version of the photographer started when I took my first prototype of my first telescope .
I &apos;ve been able to get this out of my attention , but it &apos;s a little bit different , because when I use it from the camera , I &apos;ve been able to give you a sense of the process .
When you &apos;re watching a picture with the hippocampus , it &apos;s ready when you &apos;re starting to show a picture .
In fact , photography wasn &apos;t just right in the right time .
I thought you can do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something that &apos;s starting to work after the picture of the moon .
These are images like this : this is where we &apos;re moving in a way .
But it &apos;s a unexpected game .
And yet , it looks close to reality .
Or images like this — it &apos;s just the dark color , but all of them started to protect my real reality .
I mean , I mean , I mean , <unk> .
Because , of course , these are not the images that we really can do , but how I would be able to be able to put it with a camera with a camera .
I &apos;d like to find a little bit of the pictures that we can do to be able to deal with it .
So this is based on taking a better idea than taking a moment more than taking memory .
Is it in the case of what he does ?
Is it changing with color or color ?
Is it important to work ?
What does it make ?
Sometimes it &apos;s the perspective of the <unk> .
But finally , how to deal in the world , it &apos;s the key to how to do this in 2D health .
It &apos;s not really what the reality is , but what &apos;s really happening to us .
So the main idea was very simple .
And I see this in a real place , and I see that I can make a <unk> sense of reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
And here three numbers have the physical physics of physical physics , which is different objects with three-dimensional worlds .
But when it turns out , it looks like three-dimensional objects that exist again .
And then we know that it can &apos;t exist .
So we &apos;re going to play with our brain , because the brain doesn &apos;t know that reality is not the fact of reality .
And I see the same process in the same process .
And this is actually based on different realities .
So the things that you think about is real , things that we think about , things that we think about , our everyday lives , things that are happening in our daily lives .
And it &apos;s really important to do that , because it &apos;s really important to know that , because it seems wrong .
What I want to do is have three simple rules that we have to follow to make a real deal .
As you can see , these images don &apos;t have a special thing .
But when you &apos;re busy , it takes something like this .
So the first rule has to be the same of the images of images .
The second is that the images of the space have to be the same .
And in both ways , these two objections — the same height and the same light .
And the answer is that it &apos;s a picture of the image , where it &apos;s a picture , where the other person is going to be able to figure out where the other came from .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> by how the telescope works .
In the edges of the different images , we &apos;re able to address color , <unk> and brightness , and we &apos;re able to express the edges between different images of the field , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , which is , of course , hundreds of detail .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) People can think this is the stage of a space , and you can think it &apos;s the bottom of the surface .
But in fact , this picture is completely , very , very , very , very different of the images of different places .
I think it &apos;s easier than finding a place , it &apos;s easier than finding a place , so you don &apos;t need to change your ideas .
But it takes a lot of plans .
And I had a couple of bears to find a couple of bears that are going to be able to understand the parts of the way that I had been in the winter , and I had a couple of bears .
For example , it &apos;s taken out of the surface of the world .
The audience are different landscapes .
It was taken in a rock of six pieces of rock .
And anyway , I was going into the red to be able to look at the south of the comet to look like Sweden .
So let &apos;s get a close note to reality , and I think it can be possible by my plan .
It &apos;s always a hole , a place .
It makes different pictures from it .
It &apos;s like this , every piece of a piece of good planning .
And if you &apos;re doing pictures good , it &apos;s very beautiful , and it can be very realistic .
So there are all sorts of things that we need , and the only thing that makes us risky is my imagination .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : <unk> , you &apos;re happy .
It was given this information that Woody , you know , is more information than the information that the entire world media has been published in the last year .
Can it do that ?
<unk> <unk> : Yes , can it be true ?
Is it the case that the world &apos;s world has such so bad work , right ? A little bit of activists can spread more data than the entire world .
CA : How do you do that ?
How about these tests ?
How do it protect the principle of innovation ?
MJ : As far as we know , these are the tools that are made of information . They have different ways to get us to us .
We &apos;re doing the data of countries like Switzerland and <unk> to help the rest of the world to make care of the rest of the world , like Switzerland and <unk> .
It turns out that the growth of the world is <unk> or normal , as a simple news network , which is a little bit hard to be able to be — what big data is — it can be a little bit hard — and we have to contribute to the public and the political and the political and political allies .
CA : So it &apos;s called the <unk> of the test , and you don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to work in a lot of time .
MJ : All right . We know them in the way , and if we can get the data to work , we &apos;re going to go back to the world .
( Video ) <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : Well , I think Craig , he asked TED <unk> . ( Laughter )
Let me look at examples that we have .
This is the data that &apos;s created a few years ago .
Let &apos;s look at this test .
It was a story from Kenya .
Can you talk about how you can do this story ?
MJ : This is a test called <unk> <unk> .
After the year of 2007 , he was working by Kenyan government .
For the year of 2007 , Kenya was controlled by <unk> <unk> , in 18 years ago .
In that Kenya , I was <unk> .
And when he started to fight with the Civil Rights power , they &apos;ve spent two million pounds , and they &apos;ve spent two million pounds .
The government used to be used as political power in Kenya , and now the richest man who was the richest man .
Kenya is like the holy English book .
In 2007 , I was going to go to Kenya a few years ago , and I knew that I could get the documents .
And we &apos;ve been able three days after we started to go to the patient &apos;s money with the patient &apos;s money , and we &apos;ve been able to go to the patient &apos;s money three days after this event , and after this event , he was going to go to <unk> .
CA : The short reason was that the NBA was not a way to be in the clinic of the Kenyan Kenyan press , but you think , it changed the result of the choice .
MJ : Yeah . Well , in the last page of the summer , then in the last page of Kenya , <unk> and <unk> were published in Africa .
It came out of the ground .
In a few days , the Kenyan press began to write comfortable about the issue .
It was published in Kenya for 20 days , and Kenya has changed 10 percent of the crime of Kenya , which led 10 percent of the consequences of the consequences .
CA : So the data that you have is really changing the world ?
MJ : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : This time , there &apos;s video about the air airport in the palazzo .
The body video is a little bit long . This is a short <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell you , there &apos;s a little bit of fear in this video .
RS : The water , one of the wheels .
Now they &apos;re visible , it looks like the Alhambra .
You &apos;re looking at it . Fold .
It &apos;s the news that we can see .
It &apos;s hitting them .
<unk> , jump !
( Trumpet gun ) Yeah , hey . Thank you . ( Trumpet gun ) I mean .
This is <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He had to go , right now !
We killed them , we killed eight people .
We have two <unk> , we continue to jump .
It &apos;s great . They &apos;re all dead .
<unk> , <unk> , we talk about it .
Namaste . Sorry . What was it ?
<unk> , C . Wow , it was solved .
CA : How did this impact happen ?
MJ : It was heavy for people who have the hands .
For this video , there were two people in the afternoon for the study .
This is actually one of three inches on video .
CA : If I don &apos;t smoke , if I don &apos;t have 11 people , 11 people died ?
MJ : Yeah . Two <unk> died , two children were injured .
My grandfather died , and the man died , and the man died .
CA : These are a huge <unk> of these things .
What was that anger and punishment ?
MJ : I don &apos;t know , I think people saw the <unk> of people .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> in the streets of people who are walking in the street , and it &apos;s not just a reason — and even without any reason — and they &apos;re not going to eat their wounds .
There were two journalists who were not frustrated , and they had two journalists who were not angry .
CA : In the U.S. of the United States , the <unk> of the United States was <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , in the history room , it &apos;s a series of people who have been able to show you that the <unk> of the United States has been able to be able to be able to be able to show you .
Is that true ?
MJ : We &apos;ve done this .
Five days ago , after 150 months ago , it was a prison .
This year , we &apos;ve been meeting the latest trials of the United States in the United States , but they don &apos;t have this business connection .
It was my journey .
CA : If you had the diplomatic trials of the United States ?
MJ : We were able to publish them . ( CA : Yeah . ) ( CA : Yeah . ( CA : Yeah . ) ( CA : What is it ? ) ( CA : What &apos;s the future ? ) ( Laughter ) Narrator : What is the future of the country in the Arab countries , which means the human rights in the Arab countries ?
It &apos;s like this kind of material .
CA : We &apos;re going to talk a little bit about this .
Where do you do it ? Do you have to describe it ?
Are you going to address the script of the <unk> test ?
MJ : There &apos;s a question that it &apos;s important for the world to be important , it can cause information .
The growth of the world is very likely .
They &apos;re going to be able to be able to have economic power to hide the research , and the new and good thing that you &apos;re going to be going to see is that the institutions that have these data know that they don &apos;t hide information .
It &apos;s always going to happen in the U.K. . It &apos;s about the academic history .
CA : But it &apos;s not a little dangerous , but when it &apos;s the ice , people can have a bad effect for all the society .
MJ : Well , it doesn &apos;t exist in the data that we &apos;re cutting .
I mean , we have our democratic policy .
There are some personal data that it &apos;s connected to the essence of the individual , and then we &apos;re meeting .
There &apos;s a law of law — like , it &apos;s like a patient &apos;s doctor , and they &apos;re going to protect them with the rules , but we &apos;re working with the news of what we &apos;re doing .
CA : You know , they &apos;re all good .
If you come to you in the United States , a friend who spends you in the United States , he said , &quot; &quot; You know , if you don &apos;t have the evidence that they want to spread in the future ?
People are laughing when people die when people die .
It shows millions of people in this world who are not human beings . It &apos;s not .
I &apos;m not my son . What do you choose ? &quot; &quot; What would you answer ?
MJ : They &apos;re very much like this .
But listen to your mind , Afghanistan , Iraq , the people in Afghanistan don &apos;t need to see that . They can see them every day .
It doesn &apos;t change the idea of them . They don &apos;t change their beliefs .
They see all day .
It &apos;s not changing the value of people who are going to get money for that war . That &apos;s what you want .
CA : So if you can find a way of the government and the companies of the company .
It &apos;s good to win .
But that &apos;s the strange thing that if you &apos;re going to break the numbers , you should be hidden by the power of nature .
MJ : It &apos;s not exactly that . It &apos;s still not done in Whitopia .
Or we don &apos;t have the data that we have .
If they have these things , it can be hard for us , and we &apos;re trying to do that , and we &apos;re trying to help us join our job to help us help us help us save us .
CA : Now , I &apos;m wondering that I &apos;m wondering , &quot; &quot; Well , what do I think about the TED Talk ?
There are two types of ideas about Whitopia and <unk> .
One — the players who have a lot of trouble .
The second is dangerous .
Who thought , is it the hero ?
What &apos;s dangerous ?
MJ : Well , there must be a few men who don &apos;t know .
CA : This was people , <unk> .
We have to work a little bit more . Let me show you another example .
And I think that &apos;s still the end of the time , but I think it will be published in TED .
Is it a interesting point that it &apos;s ever ever been done in this moment ?
What is this test ?
MJ : This is a example of what we see every day .
The end of the last year — in 2012 , in the Gulf of Mexico , there was a place like the Gulf of Mexico , not as powerful as the Gulf .
So we &apos;ve had a engineer account that it &apos;s actually a way to get up with the way that companies are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get
The government and others have the hands here .
Now , it wasn &apos;t any correlation with them , but it was a little bit of challenging test .
We didn &apos;t know who &apos;s written and what it was about .
We were a little bit skeptical that it can be the game of oil company .
So , we looked at the documents , and we wrote , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit skeptical .
We can &apos;t understand what we can do .
It &apos;s a test . It looks wrong , but we can &apos;t show it . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; We want to figure out the work of data , and we asked the company , &quot; &quot; We want to figure out the work of data . &quot; &quot; And we say , &quot; &quot; Give you a little bit of data .
Are you going to talk about the test ?
Is you telling you as a lawyer ?
Is you really ? &quot; &quot; And they call a picture of a documentary in the screen in the screen .
It was saved .
( Applause ) They &apos;re very much like this .
One of the ways that the bladder has been able to write a letter is one of the methods that we have to write .
CA : Do you have a calculator ?
MJ : Yeah , it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
We &apos;re going to spend the last few months to protect our social concerns to protect our role to the basics of the site .
This is a little problem .
We &apos;ve got a lot of time in a way that we &apos;ve been exposed to each other , and we don &apos;t have enough enough enough enough to publish all of these data and publish all of these data .
CA : Is it money for you to tell you that the main majority of journalists who need you to be paid for journalists and marriages ?
MJ : Yeah . It &apos;s people we &apos;re trying to believe .
It &apos;s hard to develop the data that &apos;s happening in a few different ways , and we need people who can be able to be able to be able to be able to deal with security issues .
CA : Well , why do I tell you why I &apos;m going to do this work ?
Now , I &apos;ve read , you know , I don &apos;t have 33 schools in the childhood .
Is that information ?
MJ : The body was in film business , and it was the result of the religious tradition , and it was the result of two of them .
( Laughter ) CA : Psychologists were able to be able to be able to be able to do this as well .
MJ : Do you understand the movie machine ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : You know , when I knew , you would be depressed in young age , and it would be the problem .
MJ : I was not angry .
I was one of the <unk> young journalists .
I was arrested by the magazine I published in the age of a young age .
They need to treat a little bit of food .
It can do different things with the road way .
Unfortunately , most of the hackers now are building money in the bank account for the Russians .
It &apos;s not just as an X-ray score .
CA : Well , I think , you know , you were not able to take the money of the grandmother &apos;s money . What is the important value ?
You can tell them a little bit about them , or why can you talk about what they &apos;re creating and what it creates ?
MJ : Well , I think I &apos;m not going to be .
But my main challenge is : I think I think , and people can &apos;t create pheromones ; they help them .
My father , as my father , was that I learned from people like my father .
CA : <unk> , <unk> people can create human beings ; it can affect them ?
MJ : I &apos;m a little bit of aggressive people , but I don &apos;t show them , I don &apos;t show them , but in terms of the way — I &apos;m making the victims of the people from Egypt .
This is my character that I &apos;ve been in a long time .
CA : Can you talk about what &apos;s happening in the last few minutes ?
It was the problem of the law , which was the problem of the bank , and the news of the news was to identify the results of the news .
Instead , it &apos;s the famous tragedy of the site .
You &apos;ve made good <unk> in the stage . What happened ?
MJ : That was big .
In fact , it was economic <unk> .
It was one of the largest <unk> in the world .
It was 10 times more than the other area of the bank .
We &apos;ve been meeting this information last year .
Five to five years ago in the government , he was given a diagnosis of autism , and as the movie was in the movies , he started five to five years ago , and he didn &apos;t do what he was going to do , and he didn &apos;t do what he was going to do , &quot; There &apos;s no time . &quot;
We &apos;ve been working in the state of the community , and we were in the clinic , and we &apos;ve been a lot of celebrities , and we &apos;ve heard about what we &apos;re going to do and talk about .
Every person in the community didn &apos;t think that it would be a little bit more than this . So , after a few of these islands and NGOs , the United States was given a new law project that would lead to the government in the United States , one of the most basic lawyers that are going to protect the journalists in the world , and it &apos;s one of the most fundamental attacks that they &apos;re trying to protect in the world .
In fact , he knew that he was in the Gulf of Mexico , and he knew that he was in the United States system .
And just a month ago , this law has been defined by the <unk> .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) The final question is , <unk> , <unk> .
Do you imagine how you &apos;re going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
MJ : I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re going to be .
In all the world — the United States and the United States , it &apos;s the way that you can be in the United States and the United States .
It &apos;s hard to see how you &apos;re going to go .
It &apos;s a very interesting time that we live . We can change everything with a very specific deal .
CA : If you know what we &apos;re going to say , I feel what we &apos;re going to say , <unk> , <unk> , your strength .
MJ : Thank you very much , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m writing .
I &apos;m going to tell you the story and write a novel , and I want to tell you a little bit about the art of writing the story today , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit about artificial intelligence .
But before you start to do these , let me give you my personal story .
You know , I &apos;m going to use words , and I &apos;m going to use the geometry — from the subject . You &apos;re going to have a few of you .
I &apos;m born in the University of <unk> , <unk> .
Less than this event , I &apos;m fascinated with my mother , and I &apos;m in my mother with my mother .
I &apos;ve been raised as a single kid in the middle of the middle .
In the 1970s , it was a little bit weird to live in the 1970s .
Most of the families in our kitchen were the vast families of the ancestor , and I grew up with my mother who was a single homeless woman .
In fact , I grew up with two groups of women .
It was a <unk> , <unk> , modern , <unk> , <unk> woman — my mother .
On the other hand , I was always going to go up , religion , less aggressive , less <unk> .
What I &apos;m saying is that it looks like a hole in a coffee cup , and it was a different way to get out of the skin , and it was different to bring the devil out of the skin .
The ones who were deep <unk> in their cheeks , people who were <unk> , would stop my grandmother .
Every time my grandmother said , &quot; &quot; My grandmother would say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was a number of <unk> <unk> .
And it would be a lot of the things that they &apos;ve built from the way that they built .
A week later , the patient was going to go to the <unk> .
Now , I know that I know that I know that this is strange to talk about this , and I know that there &apos;s no fun to talk about this , but I know that there are no of the people who come to my grandmother , but I know that nobody who has never been a criminal and <unk> for my grandmother .
I asked me how to do it . Is that the power of the horse ?
He says , &quot; &quot; Of course , there &apos;s no money , but it &apos;s the power of the fundamental . &quot; &quot; And in my studies , there are a lot of important lessons , and if you want to do anything in life , you need to be able to be able to take it with a <unk> , or the soul of the person , or the soul of the person .
It &apos;s going to be going to be stuck .
Every one of us is now in social and cultural issues .
We all are in it .
We &apos;re all born with a specific family , a ring , the ring .
But when we don &apos;t interact with the world in the world that we &apos;re born , we &apos;re facing the risk of the risk that we &apos;re left .
Our physical power can be a little bit . It &apos;s the lens of your body , and we &apos;re going to lose our human feeling in the environment very long in the environment .
Our friends , our neighbors , our business friends , our coworkers , our family , are changing us with our own existence .
And women like my grandmother are doing something like my grandmother , and they put out the top of the mirror , or the surface of the mirror , the surface of the mirror .
It comes from the belief that there is the left . It &apos;s not enough to look at the design of a person so many times .
And even though it &apos;s funny , it &apos;s one of the largest aspects of the global world in the world that shared a similar study .
And this leads to all the places , between <unk> and <unk> , between <unk> and beliefs , rich and poor , in the east and the West .
We &apos;re able to find together in the basis of the <unk> and the similarity , and we &apos;re making an argument about others .
When I think about my idea , the author of the writer can be the fundamental way of this cultural <unk> .
Stories can open the boundaries in our minds , but in our minds , in our minds .
We can like to love the other world as we look at other worlds , even though we see other worlds .
I started writing stories from eight years old .
One day , my mother gave me a <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; My personal story would be the good idea of writing this .
Now I think it was a little bit scary that I think this time was a little bit scared .
My stories were good to my family , but I didn &apos;t want to talk about these stories , but it wasn &apos;t good .
I was a kid who was going to talk to them , and I was a kid who was going to talk to me , and I was a kid who had a good idea , and my mother thought that he was the good idea of writing my life extensions .
But he didn &apos;t know that I thought my life was very intense , and what I wanted to do was write my life about my <unk> life .
And instead of doing this , I started writing about things that weren &apos;t about myself , not about others .
And I started to be a writer that was going to be translated in love .
And I &apos;ve been writing a lot of people who were more than the study of the book , and the stories that were more than the study of my book , the stories of others .
Take a clip : I think that &apos;s what I want to talk about .
It was another event in the top of this .
My mother became a certificate .
And I also went from this little , <unk> , remote environment , and I was the only astronomer in the school .
The first time I was looking at the hard way I could say , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; There were children from all the country , but that was the way that it would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to see it .
In fact , children in this neighborhood were considered their own identity , they were not their own <unk> .
We were in the United Nations , and it was fun , all of them were fun , and they &apos;re not talking about religion or religion .
It was like this , and he was surrounded by a child , and he was always <unk> .
And it turns out that I was in school , in this school , a military officer , and he was arrested by the Soviet gun , and he took <unk> <unk> in the <unk> music .
( Laughter ) I was thinking about being <unk> in the middle of the school .
The first time I saw this school , I saw a cultural <unk> .
And they asked all the kids about &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; They asked me to have a couple of clicks , they asked them to have a couple of tweets , and they asked me to be able to go to the <unk> .
And I learned three rhinoviruses that are linked to the tent , these are the laws , the <unk> and the end of the world .
And after the FDA , we went back to Finland , Germany and Australia .
And I thought that I think that I had a journey of <unk> and imagination in my own journey , all of these journeys .
The stories were made with me , and the <unk> and the <unk> , and I was not ashamed of these feelings .
I went to the <unk> town I loved in 20 years ago .
I lived in a very speculative place and a living place , and I wrote one of my characters here .
I was there when I was a earthquake in the Guardian .
And I left me with three or three <unk> buildings that I saw .
There was an old , old pianist , and he was talking about the <unk> , and I talked about men and <unk> lives .
It was a long black hole , and he was sitting in the tent , and he was sitting in the tent .
And I saw that I &apos;ve been allowed to give him a little bit of paper , and I saw that I had to give him a little bit of paper , and I saw it from the <unk> of the night , and I saw that in the night of the night , it &apos;s the scene of the United States , which is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re all going to go back to the way that we &apos;ve been known with the <unk> and the <unk> , and we &apos;re all going to have a couple of hours .
And I was always fascinated by the stories of stories .
I don &apos;t want to say that it &apos;s so powerful as a earthquake , but in a good case , we &apos;re going to go out of our little comfort room , and we start to recognize people that we don &apos;t have a good idea about the outside of the night .
Shortly after the event , I went to school , and I went to the college of girls .
It was not just a level of biodiversity , but it was exactly the way I look at language .
I started writing English .
<unk> , I &apos;m not going to go to school , and they ask me why to write English , and they ask me why I can change my language .
I love to write , and I think I &apos;m writing , and I think I can be able to write more and more more intuitive and more intuitive , and I think I &apos;m going to write it in English , and I think it &apos;s more interesting and logical .
I think I &apos;m connected to each other .
I learned from English as a million people around the world , and I learned about English language .
And when you learn about language , you don &apos;t have to lose the learning of the learning .
As opposed to the language , we want to tell more words , to give better words , we want to make better decisions , because we talk less , because it &apos;s a big difference between brain and language .
This difference is terrifying .
But if you don &apos;t fear it , it can be a desktop .
And this was what I learned in advertising — and I was going to see that I was living , and it was a <unk> .
And when I was in the time of all the time , I remember my grandmother , and I remember that my grandmother was going to go back to my own house , and then I asked my grandmother to go to my house , but after the first time , I had to leave it in a tent .
I built family life for me to do my grandmother .
( Laughter ) But I went to the ground instead of taking decisions together .
And when my life was in <unk> , I started to go through the <unk> , and I started to be obsessed , and I couldn &apos;t feel as deep as the world else in the world .
I was always going to go up , the physics and soul .
I mean , my stories are always my stories for my own experience and some of my experiences .
And I think that the story of the story is affecting it as much as the story of the story .
I &apos;d like to give you the idea of this issue .
One of the things that I &apos;ve been asked was that one of the things that I &apos;ve been writing in English was one of the documents that we can see in the United States .
He said , &quot; &quot; My book came to me . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; But I don &apos;t know a little bit different .
( Laughter ) I asked me what to say .
He said , &quot; &quot; If you look at your mind , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , America , there are actors , but there &apos;s a <unk> , but there &apos;s one of them . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s actually released in the University of college , which was normal to me , which was normal to me , but I didn &apos;t know what the prosecutor was going to say .
But I know that I &apos;m always going to stand with it .
He wanted to be my personal experience .
He wanted to know that I was an Indian woman in the book , and he wanted to be a college woman .
We &apos;re talking about the world &apos;s world to change the world , and we can see that we can see that politics is the impact of politics , and the impact of politics .
Most of the voters , especially the writers who don &apos;t know , are <unk> .
If you &apos;re women who are born from Islam like me , they expect you to write about Islam , and this is better than the woman &apos;s happy woman .
More than more , the <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to write the kind of stories , but you &apos;re going to write the kinds of stories from the <unk> .
In the short time , I think I &apos;ve been in the literature of the world now in the literature of the world .
<unk> are not like creative people who are passionate , but they look like the nationalism of the community , a couple of letters , a couple of months of China , one of them .
It &apos;s not one of us , but they &apos;re waiting for our culture .
When I think about the author and the <unk> Jan <unk> , they asked him about a few times a couple of times .
If you think about it as a blue writer , he was based on the <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; You can see , I don &apos;t have anything else else ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t have anything else else ? &quot; &quot; And we &apos;re looking at us with the tag .
It has a kind of unique period of science called <unk> , which is not the exception of the West .
About 10 years ago , I read the first intellectual experience in the <unk> <unk> .
We were three writers , a person from the FDA , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
( Laughter ) We didn &apos;t have faith and <unk> .
We were just our <unk> .
They &apos;re waiting to write the real stories of the author that &apos;s from the other mile .
It &apos;s based on a behavior .
This way is not just writers , but they &apos;re their own heroes , they are the more larger mass .
I &apos;m not going to do it , but it &apos;s not the beginning of the story , but it &apos;s not in the West .
It &apos;s happening all over the world .
When I first saw this in 2005 , I saw that in 2005 , he was in the case of the hero .
And I &apos;ve been working with the <unk> and the <unk> of the women and the <unk> of the women .
My little story was coming into a big <unk> problem .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I thought , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I thought , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , some of them have done me , and some of them have done me , some of them .
But I &apos;d like to tell you about two sides , but that &apos;s just science .
It &apos;s just the story .
I don &apos;t want to get the rest of the work that I &apos;ve seen when I &apos;m talking about the story .
It &apos;s not because it doesn &apos;t matter how to deal , but it &apos;s not just how it &apos;s going to happen .
<unk> are influenced in the landscape of the landscape , but the political books are enough today today , but the language language is not the language of everyday politics .
The Bible says , &quot; &quot; For example , the solution and the proper form of <unk> is different understanding .
And the second is the work of the artist . &quot; &quot; Now , we get us from each other . It &apos;s a tool .
There are a lot of choices .
The number is the number of layers .
It takes the edge .
The number of people don &apos;t recognize the answer .
It &apos;s a <unk> puzzle .
It &apos;s from water .
There were words called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; They were going to say stories that were called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; They were going to say stories as well as the history of the audience .
They change the sound in the story to express different elements of the story , and they were <unk> them .
Everyone would have been able to fear him , ordinary people , even <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Stories were not allowed to have the edges . Middle Asia , North Africa , <unk> and Asia spread to Asia .
Today , stories continue to be able to be able to be .
They listen to a couple of people talking about the Palestinian and <unk> authorities , but the author of <unk> , who read the book of the book , is connected with the story of the story .
It &apos;s going to take us further further .
If you don &apos;t do that , it &apos;s not good .
Some of the books have saved me for a while , and I had a lot of <unk> .
But the book is the opposite of the book .
After the <unk> and my hometown of my hometown , the first job was to read the first job of the first job , the first job that was written in the water , and he was writing his book .
They say , &quot; &quot; The information that doesn &apos;t have to be treated from you is more than ignorance . &quot; &quot; Today , the problem of cultural negotiations today is not because we know about each other , and we know a lot about each other , and we don &apos;t think about each other , and we don &apos;t have to go out of ourselves with the information that we &apos;re dealing with , and we can &apos;t be able to be able to get out of the other , and we can see our relationships .
There &apos;s an analogy that I &apos;m talking about : I live like the movement of the spinal cord .
One of the tribes of the iPhone becomes permanent .
The other third tribe is always doubling , and it &apos;s going on .
That &apos;s what I am .
One of the things that I &apos;m saying is that a part of what I &apos;m going to say is that the other part of that is that the other part is moving into the world , and the other part is connected between different cultures .
I believe that I believe that this is all the local , <unk> account , and I believe that it &apos;s everywhere .
You &apos;ve heard that you &apos;ve already heard the <unk> of the <unk> , which was the interest of <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s a place that &apos;s called the <unk> in the room in the table .
It &apos;s between buildings .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do very much .
We don &apos;t know that we &apos;re not going to do places between someone else .
We &apos;re looking at the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a symbol of the <unk> , which is a symbol of what we &apos;re dealing with , and we &apos;re able to predict the rest of the things that we &apos;re dealing in .
And what I think is that they have to be the <unk> of artists .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of the term , and I &apos;m going to give you a lot of <unk> .
I love the idea about 10 books .
I love my heroes to be surprised .
I can write about the Muslim woman in one of my heroes , and it will be a very happy woman . The president of the other group can be a blue professor .
We can write about everything that we have .
The <unk> House says , &quot; &quot; The girl says , &quot; &quot; We say , &quot; &quot; Oh , we say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not kidding . &quot; &quot; And I think it was a great example .
And I &apos;m going to argue , why are we going to tell students about the things you know about students , you know ?
Maybe it &apos;s not very good for this process .
It &apos;s not dependent on who we are , what we know , and how we &apos;re dealing with compassion .
We don &apos;t have to write out about the normal heart and one of us , and we &apos;re not going to write out about what we felt about .
We have to go from the Himalayas , we have to recognize other worlds .
It &apos;s like <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the same news , and they &apos;re all their own personality . And that &apos;s good news .
I &apos;m going to end up with the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; If you met , we can be friends , we can put the work on the way , &quot; &quot; we love the question ; the world is the world . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
My big ideas is a little idea that we can find the secret millions of big ideas .
I &apos;m going to do this little idea .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Here &apos;s women who are born here . <unk> .
Women are women .
And I &apos;ve been dealing with the importance of my mind .
About two years ago , I lost the <unk> .
My head was my head , and my hair was shot , the right eye was shot in five .
I started to figure out the <unk> .
And I looked at them , I said , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I can tell you , I can say that I &apos;m going to be more productive , the only way that I &apos;m happy is the normal way to be happy .
( Applause ) So we &apos;re going to be in this process that women are going to be born .
We &apos;re going to be the most vulnerable .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because so sadly , it &apos;s a <unk> for men to get less or less .
And when a person had been discharged , he started talking about what he was going to call four hours ago .
I &apos;m going to end up from my presentation , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know
Have you been five hours old now ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Most of the men are getting less people .
In particular , in the airport , you want to invite the morning to go home , and say , &quot; &quot; How are Ivan eight ? &quot; &quot; If you ask , &quot; &quot; Eight times , but nothing , it &apos;s a little bit like , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re about eight times , but it &apos;s not just what you &apos;re going to see with you . &quot; &quot; They would say , &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not so , because they &apos;re not in the case , because it &apos;s a lot of economic , political , and commercial institutions that have a lot of decisions .
It &apos;s going to be a lot of <unk> .
It &apos;s not going to be the good leader , but it &apos;s going to be the good leader before you touch a great leader .
It &apos;s enough for our atmospheres to be enough .
And I think they would be right if they were the great investment bank , who had a great investment bank , and they were <unk> , and they would still be right .
( Applause ) The girls were able to have a <unk> , or eight hours , or eight hours , or eight hours , and he could figure out what it would mean , maybe maybe .
One of the best things that we &apos;ve been known with is the best of all the world that we live with , which is useful for us , which is useful for us , which is useful for us , and it &apos;s the best of all the world that we live with .
And I hope that you can see the power of your mind to know the big ideas in the future , and you see the power of your mind , you see the power of the mind .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
My brother &apos;s brain is the disease of the brain .
What &apos;s the problem ?
Dr. Friedman .
&quot; &quot; It &apos;s normal .
And when I looked at my brain , I learned that there was a disease in my brain .
I was like a baby kid in the patient .
If you hear the brain , you can see that the brain is made from two independent parts of the brain .
This is the part of the body with the brain .
The next half of them is a <unk> process .
It was the opposite of two half of them .
And I think it &apos;s going to look at different things , and it would take attention to different things .
Let me give you a minute . Thank you very much . ( Laughter ) ( Beatboxing ) Yeah .
The right brain is learning with images that you can see with images .
The data that &apos;s going into energy is the same time , and the data is moving into all of the sense of view now , how it looks , how it looks , how it feels , how it feels , how it feels , how it feels , how it feels , how it feels .
We have a energy that &apos;s associated with the environment of our right brain .
And this is what we &apos;re looking at in this point , right and beautiful .
We &apos;re a half of the brain , which is a completely different place .
It &apos;s an example of an example of a half .
It &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of the data that &apos;s ready to get up to a half of them , and it &apos;s unique to him .
And the left brain is thinking about language .
The world is connected to the natural world .
This voice is telling us , &quot; &quot; When I was home , you &apos;re not going to be a <unk> .
You know , when you don &apos;t want to leave it , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to be able to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , you know , you know , you know , you have to be able to do it .
So , I was in my own job . I started practicing .
I think that I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
I feel that your body is slow .
And when I was trying to get a shower in the kitchen room , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And when I tried to get a shower in the kitchen room , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And when I was trying to get a shower in the kitchen room , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And when I was trying to get a shower in the kitchen room , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And when I was trying to get a shower in the kitchen room , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; &quot; (
I hear the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; .
And I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re in the wall with atoms and molecules in the wall .
The only thing I could do was the natural energy — it was power .
And I said , &quot; &quot; What was I going to do ?
I &apos;m all doing all of the things that I &apos;ve been doing .
I feel oxygen in my feet . Take it .
Start your eye to the front of your eye .
It was amazing .
And then my left brain goes back .
And I &apos;m in the right hand right now .
My government is like , &quot; &quot; Oh !
( Laughter ) And then I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , sir . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I don &apos;t have time . &quot;
I &apos;ve got to want to be a car , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a call . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking about it .
I try to call it .
And when I went back , I &apos;m going to be able to be able to do the numbers .
So that one of the numbers that I &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to do with my hand is that I &apos;m going to take the number of numbers that I &apos;m going to get on the phone .
But I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about Gill <unk> .
Or I &apos;m going to get my life to my life .
And my brain is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
What &apos;s great is how big it is , how to do my life .
And maybe I &apos;m going to be surrounded with a very powerful moment .
If you choose to meet the right brain , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to meet the right brain .
