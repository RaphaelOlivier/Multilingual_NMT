It was a 2005 holiday afternoon .
I worked from scientific media in the United States , the National Rights Movement .
It would be my work , but precisely that day I felt a little programmer .
So I found myself to the crowd-sourcing of my fellow Chris Hancock .
Chris took over 30 years working in the United States , so she knew well how the institutions .
I told Chris that I felt a little bit awkward .
I was researching a number of issues about the intersection of science and commitments : very interesting .
But I wanted the United States to address these more expensive problems , in a way that could make a difference .
Chris was straight to the big , and I asked me , &quot; &quot; All of those issues , what are the five who are more <unk> ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
&quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the genetic discrimination , the partial technologies , the biomolecules and ...
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you that there &apos;s also a great , the job of the <unk> as a lie of lies and ...
Of course , the theme of genetic <unk> .
&quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s , &quot; &quot; human genes .
&quot; No ! &quot;
What would I say that the American government of parts of the human body ?
It can &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; I looked at my <unk> and I sent Chris three articles .
And 20 minutes later , he came up with <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! You had right ! What do you want to demand ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s that Chris is a big lawyer , but I didn &apos;t know almost anything about <unk> legislation and absolutely nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> , much less <unk> .
It was clear that there was a lot of learning before to demand anyone .
First , we had to know exactly what if someone dared a gene .
The genetic <unk> tend to include dozens of <unk> , but the more discussed of all are the so-called DNA DNA , or it &apos;s , a piece of DNA that detects a cell .
The <unk> of this says , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t underestimate the genes of your body , we hold the <unk> genes . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , the <unk> problem that you need to isolate the genes to use them .
And the shopkeepers don &apos;t cancel a <unk> gene , but all of the possible versions of the gene .
And what does this mean ?
Because you can &apos;t spend your genes to a physician and ask that the <unk> , to see if you have mutations , without the user of the <unk> .
It also means that the speaker &apos;s name has the right to stop that that gene comes on in research or clinical trials .
Let &apos;s say that these languages , often private companies , <unk> parts of the human genome was hurting patients .
We have the case of <unk> , a small 10-year-old , a heart disease that if it &apos;s not about it , it can give the sudden death .
The company that parodied the two genes associated with this disease create a test to diagnose cancer .
But then he went in <unk> , and they never got to offer it .
But the company who put the shopkeepers caught with demand by infecting the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to show you a few years ago , two years without able to do the test .
During that time , Amitabha died from <unk> <unk> without diagnosing .
The genetic salesmen were a problem that impairs patients .
Is there some way to do it ?
It turns out that the <unk> leaves clear in a long list of previous cases , which are a series of things that are not legal .
You can &apos;t afford the products of nature : air , water , <unk> , the elements of the <unk> table .
Not the laws of nature : the law of gravity , and = = .
They &apos;re very fundamental things , and they must be at the grasp of all , and they need to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that .
In our opinion the DNA , the most fundamental life structure , which encode the production of all our proteins , is so much a product of nature as a law of nature , regardless that you find in our bodies or at the bottom of a <unk> .
To give us better , we travel throughout the country to talk to different experts : scientists , doctors , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers .
Most told us that we had reason of a political view , and when less in theory , according to a legal view point .
They all thought that the possibilities of moving with our own subject were so much like scratch .
But why ?
It turns out that the employer &apos;s office leads to these more than 20 years .
<unk> , there were thousands of <unk> of human genes .
The papaya vessel was very <unk> in the status quo , the biotech industry grew around this practice , and the legislation to empower genetic <unk> has been calculated year after year to Congress , without before before .
Briefly : the troops wouldn &apos;t be willing to <unk> these diapers .
But not Chris , and I &apos;m scared of the challenges , and that they said , &quot; &quot; You have no reason enough , &quot; &quot; gives a lot more amounts to follow .
So we started looking at our cause .
<unk> judgments are likely to be : They individualize the <unk> B for some technical , dark topic .
We didn &apos;t care that kind of causes , we think our cause is worth much more .
It &apos;s about science freedom , medical progress and the rights of patients .
So we decided to open a cause that wouldn &apos;t be like the typical ones that are for <unk> , but a cause of civil rights state .
We proved to identify a computer headline that was given to defend their diapers to then organize a patchwork of competing and experts that tell them to the Russians like these barbers written in lust of patients and innovation .
We think the ideal candidates to demand was Ludwig <unk> , a company with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> put the <unk> of two genes , <unk> genes and <unk> .
Women with certain mutations in these genes have more likely to get pancreatic cancer and <unk> .
It &apos;s a total <unk> of the BBC &apos;s discovery in the United States .
He did that many labs stopped offering <unk> tests .
There were many money for his test : over 3,000 dollars .
They &apos;re going to share their clinical data with international science community .
And if you look at the worst of all , for a period of a period of a couple of years , <unk> has provided to update their test so that they include immune mutations that were identified by a team of researchers in France .
He calculated that during that period , for several years , to a 12 percent of women who did them get their test to get a abusive response : a negative outcome that should be positive .
This is Kanzi <unk> .
Jennifer &apos;s sister , <unk> , developed cancer with 40 years and made the test with <unk> .
The test made it negative .
The family sank .
The most likely was that that cancer wasn &apos;t present in the family , so the other family members didn &apos;t need to do the test .
Two years later , Kaggle was diagnosed in advanced state cancer .
He turned out that the sister of Jennifer found out between that 12 percent of people who received a negative <unk> outcome .
If Evan gets the right result , <unk> would have the test , and avoid his own <unk> cancer .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that we could be able to integrate these problems .
These genetic groups , defense organizations , defense organizations , <unk> organizations that were involved over 150,000 scientists and medical professionals , and individual women who or well couldn &apos;t afford the Stirling exam , or well they wanted a second note that they couldn &apos;t give them , because of the <unk> .
One of the main challenges we &apos;re facing when we preach this case was thinking the way to explain science .
To argue that what did Márquez wasn &apos;t a inventory , and that the tamper-proof genes were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , of the kind : What is a gene ? What is DNA ?
How do DNA island , and why isn &apos;t that a anomaly ?
We spend hours and hours with our endeavors and experts , trying to give the way to explain these concepts differently .
And at the end we end up by a handful of the metaphor , like the gold .
So <unk> DNA is how to extract a mountain , or the bottom of a river .
You can manipulate the process to extract your spouse , but you can &apos;t afford your own spouse .
Now it &apos;s got a job of work to extract the mountain of the mountain ; you can &apos;t afford it , it &apos;s still listening .
And the weather , once busy , can use all kinds of things in which you couldn &apos;t use when it was on the mountain ; with it , to do x , for example . But you can &apos;t afford the cow , because it &apos;s still listening .
In 2009 we were ready to present the case .
And we introduced it to the <unk> <unk> of New York in New York City , and the case was executed , the renowned explanation of Robert Stewart .
In March 2010 , the judge <unk> his <unk> : 72 pages . A total victory for us .
When we read his opinion , they set up the <unk> with the science that described science in case .
I mean , our report — it was pretty good , but not so good .
How could I develop a very profound knowledge of the subject in so little time ?
We couldn &apos;t imagine how it could be possible .
So that resulted that the Apple judge worked from that , not only was a lawyer — it was scientific .
And it wasn &apos;t only scientific — it was a doctor in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) Crazy luck !
So Archie appealed to the Prince of the Middle Ages .
And here the things were interesting .
First , in a vital moment of this case , the United States government moved around .
At the grandstand , government gave a report to the Fountain of <unk> .
But in contact straight to his own <unk> office , government noticed a report in which he said that he imagined this subject to the light of the shooter &apos;s decision , and it turns out that the isolated DNA wasn &apos;t evident of being paid .
This was very important , and completely unexpected .
The Bureau of Labor <unk> takes all of the <unk> cases , and it &apos;s called their very , very , very much of the <unk> of the <unk> .
So even with this silent event , we were told to lose .
And so it was .
Less or less .
The decision was two against one .
But the two <unk> that voted against us , they did for completely different reasons .
The first one , the <unk> judge , drew his own and new biological theory , completely high-pitched .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
<unk> often implicated that , so it didn &apos;t have sense .
The other judge , the <unk> judge , said that it agreed with us instead of being the DNA <unk> a product of nature .
But what &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to <unk> the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , the <unk> judge , gave us the reason .
You have to present a question that you want you to respond to the <unk> .
So these questions take the shape of a <unk> paragraph , often a page with lots of <unk> , where it &apos;s like so much .
We did what you were looking at was the shortest question that you &apos;ve ever received .

When Chris asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well I don &apos;t know .
I think you &apos;d have to say , &quot; Is it the <unk> DNA ? &quot; &quot; No .
I want the retinas to have the same reaction that I &apos;ve been talking about about this subject seven years ago . &quot; &quot; And of course , what would I say ?
The <unk> only around one percent of the cases that we did , and accepted to listen to our own .
It takes the day of the coral media , and it was very , very exciting — with many people outside , people who have led to the next two : 30 of the <unk> to try to get in the judge .
Two organizations against titanium cancer , they organize a demonstration to the <unk> stream .
Chris and I walked together in the hallway , moments before he comes to defend the most important case of his career .
I was much more nervous .
But all that panic <unk> when I joined in the room and I saw around me a lot of known faces : women who were known and to attend their everyday stories , the geneticists who sacrificed a lot of time from their careers to train this fight , embeddedness from a variety of landscapes that present justifications to the grandstand .
In the room , they were three masters of the Human Genome Project , including the <unk> of DNA , James <unk> , who presented him a report to the grandstand , where he said that they would pay genes was a &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of communities represented in the room and the current ones that each one came on to do this day said much of what we had in play .
The socialist betrayal .
Chris has made a brilliant way .
But for me , the most passionate thing was to see the <unk> of the <unk> to try to understand the <unk> DNA , a series of visceral analogies and discussions in a very similar way to how we did our legal team for the last seven years .
The medieval judge has sparked the tapioca island to extract a medical plant of <unk> .
The Robert judge gave him a baseball garden from a tree .
And when it wasn &apos;t my own moment , the <unk> judge determined that the <unk> DNA was nature to expect . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When we left that day of the judge we felt very concise , but I could also leverage the outcome : nine to 4 .
A natural section of DNA is a product of nature , and it &apos;s not enough to be paid as just because it was isolated .
And what &apos;s more , <unk> did not prove anything . &quot; &quot; Twenty hours after the decision , five labs announced that they started offering the test for the <unk> genes .
Some of them have been offered to offer the most cheap test of <unk> .
Some of them were offering a more described examination to offer <unk> .
But the warden &apos;s decision was from <unk> .
It took a $ 25 practice that allowed them to make human genes in the United States .
<unk> <unk> that changed innovation and investigative research .
And they helped patients like <unk> , Kalashnikov and <unk> had access to the test they needed .
A few weeks later , his decision broke his decision , I got a little duck in the email box .
It was Sir <unk> <unk> , a professor of <unk> University and one of the first people that I and Chris went to visit .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ve got a lot of this case .
Places that gave us the <unk> to address those risks was to know that we were doing the right thing .
The process lasted almost eight years of the beginning to end , with lots of valleys and <unk> at the way .
Of course , lucky help , but they were the communities that we &apos;ve taken , and the alchemy we created , those who gave us to them .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to show you a bunch of <unk> from my projects , done in collaboration with the artist &apos;s artist Dam for .
We need to call us calendars , and we live and we work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Apples phone . &quot; &quot; I looked at the peculiar habit of my uncle to ask myself constantly that makes things for him , almost as if I was a crowd of his body : turning the lights or take a water pot or a candy package .
When I grew up , the thing was the worst and I started to see how a way of control .
Of course , I couldn &apos;t say anything never because the uncle is a very respected figure in the immediate family .
What I was going to dive up and <unk> was his phone use .
He would take the piano , and he would expect what I became the number for him .
In response and how I &apos;ve done for my great uncle , I &apos;ll show you &quot; &quot; The Apples . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that they have no two people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a telephone phone to a person .
The problem is that when I &apos;m walking home and I went to university , I started to take less their actions .
So I did a <unk> machine that could give her <unk> and <unk> all over the world &apos;s <unk> email email .
What I had to do was take a paper , put the paper in the office , write your email or detect and paste the role .
This device would send automatically to the person in question the letter in email style .
Here you can see that we expose a lot of mobile devices that understand all mechanical actions and converts it into digital .
So my uncle just treated with a mechanical interface .
And of course , the object has to be <unk> and having a <unk> <unk> , as you like my uncle .
The next job is a sensitive device to the sound that we call &quot; &quot; The <unk> . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the level of being surrounded from a arsenal of pale , sensitive creatures .
This works like this . We have these jeans here on the wall , and behind , we have these little creatures that bite .
And instead of worrying about silence , they <unk> .
And if there &apos;s more silence still , you get the birch .
And I &apos;m like , you look new .
So we have these posters in three walls of a room .
And we had a thousand of these little <unk> stacked behind .
And that &apos;s how it works .
This is a video prototype .
When there &apos;s silence , you go behind the warheads , and you &apos;re going to see it .
And it turns out that we &apos;re going to be able to understand how humans or real creatures are .
And they &apos;re also immune to the sound that they &apos;re scared of at a little bit .
They don &apos;t respond to the valleys .
You &apos;ll see a towel at a moment where they don &apos;t respond .
( Laughter ) But they respond to the sound in the foreground . You &apos;ll see that in a second .
( Laughter ) We work very hard to do the most challenging possible .
Each <unk> has their own behavior , <unk> , meaning , humor , etc .
This is a very premature prototype .
Of course , it was the best after that .
We made them respond to people , but we saw that people were quite <unk> and child with them .
This is a video device called &quot; &quot; The thoughtless person . &quot; &quot; We were pretty impressed with the idea of play with the <unk> of heritage .
How would it be possible to experience the bias ?
We worked with a special company in surveillance cameras and we asked them to create software with a camera that could look at people in the room , following these people and replacing a person in the background , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you a very premature prototype .
On the right , you can see my colleague <unk> , which , in fact , is in space .
And on the left , you see the <unk> video where the camera makes it invisible .
They &apos;re going to go on the fourth . Go ! It &apos;s invisible .
You can see how the camera goes down and the <unk> .
It &apos;s a premature video , so we still don &apos;t treat the crew and all that , but it has evolved quickly , more .
We &apos;ve been in a room where there was a camera looking at space , and we had a monitor in each wall .
And second people walked in the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except by a difference : a person was constantly invisible where they want to move in the room .
This work is called &quot; &quot; The <unk> of the sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a paper gap , like a proxy of a child &apos;s-eye <unk> or a sun .
On the front , this object seemed to be very strong and linen and forth , almost it seemed very weak .
People would walk on the room and almost ignore it thinking that it was some <unk> .
But in how black they were , it would start craving the wall in a screeching way .
<unk> and <unk> always .
( Laughter ) This work is a comment of a <unk> man .
Your head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , which seems that it falls in his shadow and his body grows from almost like a plant .
What it does is move around your head as if it was a maid in a very <unk> motion and it &apos;s pretty slow .
It &apos;s as driven by that circle .
Because if that circle wasn &apos;t there and the soil was very floors , it would start to dig through space .
And there are no wires .
I &apos;ll show you a example . When people enter in the room , it &apos;s going to change this object .
And very slowly , in a couple of minutes , it &apos;s completely creepy , taking speed , and it seems like it &apos;s the point of departure .
This is a important moment because we wanted to convey a instinct to almost go and help or save the subject .
Even though it doesn &apos;t need it because he &apos;s really able to stand again .
This work was a technical challenge for us and we work very hard , like most of our jobs , for years to get a mechanical , a balance and a perfect dynamic .
It was very important for us to establish the precise moment in which it was going to fall , because if we were doing it so that they lose balance , then it gets it , and if it wasn &apos;t enough enough , it doesn &apos;t include that infection , or that effect of wanting to go to help .
I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we make a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my fellow . I &apos;m going to go .
Now this is adding nervous , so it &apos;s going to take it .
But it doesn &apos;t need to do , because it can follow itself .
This is a work that we &apos;ve been very <unk> , working with the <unk> of the skin surrounded with thousands of tiny pieces of optical optical , which <unk> like the night sky .
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
We looked at this around a paragraph with a <unk> store , who was visiting from the rooftop .
The idea was to hire something so cold , especially and abstract like the universe with a family bear bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
The idea was that in a moment you would never look at the shape of a <unk> bear and almost feeling like a hole in space , like if you &apos;re looking at a brilliant glass sky .
This is the last job , even in process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; space Space . &quot; &quot; Imagine a little bit of this in front of you in the middle of the room , and that , if you &apos;re looking at you , you try to <unk> it into a frequency twice than high and four times its volume .
This object is in constant sprawl and tribulations to create a dynamic with people moving barefoot , like they try to hiding a secret in their own together or something like that .
We work with a lot of technology , but actually we don &apos;t like it because it causes a lot of suffering in our work for years and years .
But we use because we &apos;re interested in the way we help us understand emotions and patterns of behavior in these creatures that we create .
When a creature comes back to mind , and almost like the creation process was finding the way that this creature wants to exist , that way to take and how to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to begin to give you a useful trick not technology and all of you need you to be this : that you change posture for two minutes .
But before I would dive up , I want to ask you now that you &apos;ll see your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
See , how many of you are in some way in footprints ?
<unk> , with the <unk> legs , the <unk> <unk> .
Sometimes we put their arms like this .
Sometimes we try them . ( Laughter ) What I see you .
<unk> attention to what you do right now .
Let &apos;s go back to this in a few minutes , and I hope that if you learn to modify it a little bit can change the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re fascinated with the body language and we interact especially to other people &apos;s body language .
You know , you &apos;re looking at — this , wow — ( Laughter ) a slight interaction , a smile of eye eye , a <unk> loop or even something like a hand wheel .
Audience : Here are going to the number 10 .
This police has lucky and gives her hand to the president of the United States .
There &apos;s the first Minister — not . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Amy <unk> : A hand hose , or his owner , can give us to talk for weeks and weeks .
And I &apos;m going to show you a lot of people , even to the BBC and the New York Magazine .
So when we think about nonviolent expression or body language , we call us not verbal ; we talk about language , for both communication .
When we talk about communication , we think about interactions .
What drives me your body language ?
What do you communicate with me ?
There are reasons to believe that it &apos;s building this approach .
Sociologists spend a lot of time or from other people , about the arguments .
We make arguments and <unk> of body language .
These judgments can predict important projections in life like whom we fall to or promote or whom we asked a quote .
For example , I <unk> <unk> , born in the University of Auguste , showing that when someone sees 30 seconds of video video without real interactions , their arguments about the doctor &apos;s annihilation to recognize whether that doctor will be prepared or not .
So it doesn &apos;t have to see so much if the doctor was or not , but if you liked that person and how you interact .
Even more <unk> , <unk> , in Princeton , demonstrated that the judgments of the blind candidates of political candidates testified in a second 70 percent of the career result to government and the age of the US and even , in digital fashion , the <unk> beetles in the Eurogroup , can drive more value to that disaster .
If you do a bad use of them is bad idea , not ?
Speaking of no verbal language is to talk about how we judge others , how to judge us and what the consequences are .
But we tend to forget the other audience in which it impacts our non-native language , that we are ourselves .
It &apos;s based on our non-verbal language , our thoughts , feelings and gratification .
What can &apos;t I be talking about ?
They &apos;re social designers , and I &apos;ve studied the ratings and gave a class of business school , so it was inevitable that I was interested with power dynamics .
It involves me about all no non-visual expressions of power and master .
What are the <unk> cues of power and master ?
Well , why are this .
In the animal horizon , you have to see with sprawl , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
So we &apos;re going to be able to do a lot of things that we can do with them , to make large , <unk> space , double space , basically open .
It &apos;s about opening .
And it works like this in all the animal shapes , and it works like this .
It &apos;s not just the primates .
Humans do the same . ( Laughter ) They do that when they have a permanent way and also when they feel powerful at the moment .
This is especially interesting because it shows us the old and the <unk> that are these power expressions .
This expression , who has known as a surprise , was studied by Jessica Curie , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what I want to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t want to do it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t want to do it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
And I &apos;m going to tell you that so much people who see that they &apos;ve been born as the people who are blind , they have the same when they win a physical competition .
So when you cross the goal line and you win it doesn &apos;t matter if you never saw anyone doing it .
They do that .
Small arms in your hands , I would say something loudly .
What do we do when we feel helpless ?
We do just the opposite .
We take it . We &apos;ve seen it .
We get small .
We don &apos;t want to get out of who &apos;s around us .
And so animals like humans do the same .
And this is what happens when they &apos;re struggling with care .
What we tend to do when it comes to power is limited to the <unk> language of others .
So if someone shows very powerful with us , we tend to make us smaller . We don &apos;t imitate it .
We make the opposite .
If I see this behavior in class , what ?
Whereas the United Nations students have seen all the non-visual language of power .
There are people who are on the middle of the subway , come on the front of the table , sit in the middle before you start class , as if you wanted to take space .
When you sit , you seem to expand .
They get your hand like this .
Then there are other people who are going to get up practically expanding .
He sees it in his face and his body , sitting in the chair and they &apos;re tiny , and they do that when they wake up your hand .
Here &apos;s two things .
One doesn &apos;t surprise you .
It seems to have to see sex .
Women are more prone to making men .
Women are always less powerful with men , so this is not surprising .
But the other thing I noticed is that it seems to be related to the Ministry of students and their level of participant .
And this is very important in the class of the CIA because the participant is based on the middle of the menu .
Business schools have been fighting with the differences of scores for sex .
You see women and men alike , and then you see these differences in the notes , which seems to be <unk> in part of the participant .
So I started asking myself , &quot; &quot; If there are people who come with that attitude and participate , we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Could we be able to do that , it would be possible to do others to innovate , and that &apos;s going to lead them to participate more ?
My collaborator Dan <unk> , who is in <unk> , and I wanted to know if you can get to do it .
Is you saying , can you do just a moment and experience a result in your behavior that makes you feel more powerful ?
We know that futureless language doesn &apos;t matter what other people feel and think about us . There are a lot of tests .
But our question was , &quot; &quot; Absolutely , does language not see what we feel and think about ourselves ?
There are evidence that this is .
For example , we smile when we &apos;re happy , but also when we make them laugh to be able to get a dog with teeth like this , they make them happy .
It works in the two directions .
When it comes to power , it also works in two directions .
When we feel powerful is more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we limit being powerful is more likely that we really feel powerful .
Well , the second question in reality was , well , we already know that the mind changes our body , but it &apos;s right also that the body changes our mind ?
And when I say mind , in the case of powerful , what am I talking about ?
I talk about thoughts and feelings and the physiological components that make these thoughts and feelings , and in my case , I talk about hormones .
How is the mind of the powerful compared to what &apos;s not ?
The powerful people tend to be , it &apos;s not surprising , more assertive and insurance , more optimistic .
They have the sense that they &apos;re going to win yourself in games of cognition .
They also tend to think about a more abstract way .
There are lots of differences . They get more risks .
There &apos;s a full of differences between the powerful and the ones that are not .
<unk> also gets differences in two fundamental hormones : the manufacturers , which is the hormone of dominance , and the <unk> , which is the lung hormone .
<unk> <unk> with a lot of power in the <unk> of primates have high levels of <unk> and low levels of <unk> , and the powerful and effective leaders and effective leaders are going to be able to do that .
What does this mean ? When I talk about power , I &apos;m going to tell you just about the <unk> , because I had to see with the master .
But power also has to see with our reaction to stress .
Do we want a dominant leader , with a lot of power , with high <unk> levels but sensitive to stress ?
You may probably not , right ?
We want a person who &apos;s powerful , assertive and dominant but not very sensitive to stress , a person who &apos;s full .
We know that in the frames of primates , if a moose has to take control , if someone has to embrace the controls , then take that role , in the term of a few days , his tested tested a lot and the <unk> .
We have that evidence , that the body can beautify the mind , at least the visual level , and also the key role can beautify the mind .
So what happens when you give me a role shift ? What happens if you go to a funeral , like this little manipulation or intervention ?
You say , &quot; &quot; I want you to do for two minutes , so that makes you feel more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
We decided to bring people to the lab and make a small experiment , those people have taken , for two minutes , both the circles , and power or assets , and I &apos;m going to show you just five of those hands , even if they settled only two .
This is one .
One more couple of people are going to be able to be able to do that .
The press called &quot; &quot; awe &quot; &quot; called &quot; &quot; awe &quot; &quot; .
Here we have a couple more .
You can be standing , or sitting .
Here are the same assets .
Now , they get small .
This is very low power .
When you touch the viewer , you can really .
This is what happens .
They come out , take a <unk> , and you &apos;ll tell you for two minutes : &quot; &quot; You have to do this or that . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the photos of the position .
We don &apos;t want to innovate with a concept of power .
We want you to feel power .
They have this two minutes .
So we asked them , &quot; &quot; How powerful are you ? &quot; &quot; So we gave them the opportunity to bet , at the end we take another <unk> show .
That &apos;s all . This is all the experience .
This is what we found .
<unk> to risk , let &apos;s find that when they &apos;re in a high power position , we find that when they &apos;re in a high position of power , they &apos;re going to go back to 86 percent .
When they &apos;re in the low power position , only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant difference .
Let &apos;s look at what we found with <unk> .
From their normal situation to get , the powerful people experience a increase of 20 percent and the Philistines experience a 10-percent rate .
Again , two minutes , and you &apos;ve got those changes .
Now the results with <unk> .
The most powerful experience about 25 percent of diminishment , the poorest ones experience a increase about 15 percent .
Only two minutes will cause these hormone changes that are set up your brain to make emotional , safe or <unk> , or well for stress , and feel like it turned out .
We all know that feeling , right ?
It turns out that our language doesn &apos;t see the way we see ourselves , not just sometimes , but ourselves .
The body can change the mind .
The next question , of course , is — can a power gesture in a few minutes change life differently ?
This is in the lab , this experiment , it &apos;s only two minutes .
Where can you really apply this ?
That &apos;s what worries us .
We think where you need it is in the situation where you &apos;ve measured , how in the esoteric social issues , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to do that .
And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going
For teenagers , it &apos;s at the bedside table .
For some people is talking about school office .
It can be to present a business or give a talk like this or go to a job interview .
We take one thing that most people identify because many of them went through it , the job interview .
So we published the results , the press <unk> and said — well , this is what you have to do when you go to a interview , not ?
( Laughter ) Of course we were surprised and said , no , for God , no , it &apos;s not what we wanted to say .
For many reasons , no , don &apos;t do that .
Again , it &apos;s not about telling other people .
It &apos;s about talking to you .
What do you do before you go to a job interview ?
You &apos;re sitting . Look at your iPhone — or your Android , we &apos;re not going to leave anyone outside .
Hold your text messages , you &apos;re blazing , you make small , when really what you should be doing is this , maybe in the heart , it &apos;s going ? Go two minutes .
That &apos;s what we want to meditate , right ?
We sent people to the lab , and they took high and low <unk> and even able to get a <unk> interview , and they started a <unk> interview .
And I &apos;m going to show you a lot of examples of five minutes of <unk> . We &apos;re recording .
Also , they &apos;re tracking them , and the retinas are trained to not give it no verbal overhaul .
Imagine that this person interviewing you .
For five minutes , nothing , it &apos;s worse than you interact .
People hate this .
That &apos;s what <unk> <unk> calls &quot; &quot; to be in social <unk> . &quot; &quot; This leaves the <unk> .
This is the interview that we did , because we wanted to see what happened .
We have designers look at the tape , four in total .
They don &apos;t know the hypothesis . You don &apos;t know the conditions .
They don &apos;t have no idea that it could take each person and at the end of looking at all the strings , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to fight these people , all of the position of power .
We don &apos;t want to fight and others .
We give you a much more positive estimate in general . &quot; &quot; What was happening ?
It &apos;s not about the content of speech .
It &apos;s about the presence that has been handed to speech .
Because we measured all those different variables to the stimulus : How do we do it well ?
Do you get good ? What ratings have ?
These things don &apos;t affect . That &apos;s what affects it .
This kind of thing .
Every person <unk> itself , basically .
They do what they &apos;re .
They change their ideas , for themselves , without any extra .
So this is what it causes or the effect of effect .
When I talk to people about this , our body changes our mind and behavior can change our way to be , say , &quot; &quot; It seems to be Treason . &quot; &quot; I did ?
I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you do it .
I &apos;m not like that .
I don &apos;t want to get there and feel like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel like a imposter .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feel that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
This is very important for me , because I want to tell you a little story about being a <unk> and how it wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
When I was 19 years old , I memorized a terrible car accident .
I &apos;ve been told about it , and I gave a lot of voltage back .
I &apos;ve been told about the car .
I went into intensive care with a wound in my head , and they took me from college and I told that my CIA crossed two standard requirements . It was very <unk> .
I met my IQ because I would immerse me as a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to find myself a terrible girl .
So I got out of college and I got back .
They said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t finish the career .
You have to accept that there are other things that you can do , but in your case this doesn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; I had to deal with that , and I have to say that you take your identity , what really , that for me was smart , that you &apos;ll get care of it , it &apos;s the thing that I can do to feel .
I sat completely picky .
So I worked , and I worked , and I was lucky , and I worked , and I was lucky , and I worked .
I finally graduated in college .
I took four years more than my classmates , and I would convince someone , my <unk> <unk> , Swann <unk> , so that I was scared , and I was in Princeton , and I felt like I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
The night before of a course of a course , I had to be able to do a lot of things .
That &apos;s that .
I had so much fear of myself left the next day that I called and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to leave anything , because I prayed for you and you &apos;re going to stay .
They &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
They &apos;re going to do all the exhibitions that are joining you .
It just leaves it , and to do and do it , even if you &apos;re frightened or even paralyzed , and it has a substantial experience , until you get the moment that you say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
I arrived here . I &apos;m doing now . And that &apos;s what I did .
<unk> years of college , a few years ago , you know , in <unk> , I went to Harvard , now I &apos;m in Harvard , I don &apos;t think it wasn &apos;t going to be there .
The end of my first year in Harvard , a student who didn &apos;t talk about the class in all of the desk , so they said , &quot; &quot; Look , you have to participate or you &apos;re going to survive , &quot; &quot; came to my finger . I didn &apos;t know before .
Totally defeated , I said , &quot; &quot; It shouldn &apos;t be here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
That was my moment .
Because two things were gone .
The first thing I realized : Go ! I don &apos;t feel like this .
I didn &apos;t feel like this , but she and <unk> in his place .
The second one was , of course it must be here !
Let &apos;s go , which can smell and can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . Yes you must be here ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
It turns out you &apos;re going to make it powerful , you &apos;re going to make powerful , and you know what — ( Applause ) You &apos;re going to go to class and you &apos;re going to give the best speech of everybody . &quot; &quot; And you know ? I did the best speech of everybody , people would go to it and say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t even think that if you sit there . ( Laughter ) I saw the walls for a few months later , and I realized that it was no longer going to transform it .
In order to change it .
Now I want to tell you that there &apos;s no way that it &apos;s going to do it .
There is that it turns out to transform .
There are that enough enough to transform and control .
The last thing I &apos;m going to say is this .
Different changes can lead the big transformations .
It &apos;s only two minutes .
And I want to look at the next situation where you &apos;ve measured , for two minutes , trying this , in the <unk> , in the middle of the Davos , on the end of the closed door .
This is what you have to do .
It allows the brain to achieve the best of this situation .
It &apos;s <unk> . <unk> the <unk> .
You don &apos;t go from that situation feel like I didn &apos;t show you who they are .
I &apos;m aware of that situation with the feeling I &apos;m going to say who are and I &apos;m going to prove .
I want to ask you before nothing you adopt a position of power , and I also want to invite you to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t depend on this . ( Laughter ) <unk> , show people , because the best ones can use it are those without resources or technology , without position or power .
I specialize with them because they can do in private .
They only need their body , privacy and two minutes to change dramatically the projections of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the most big problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The G20 &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good option .
( Laughter ) No , I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s the big problems of the world ?
And I mean , before I continue , I ask you every one of you that you take nesting and paper because I &apos;m going to ask you to help me see how we do it .
So take makeup and paper .
On the end of the count , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world outside there .
I &apos;m going to list just some .
800 million people are going to survive .
<unk> million people don &apos;t have access to skeletal water .
Two billion without <unk> .
Millions of people die from HIV and AIDS .
The list continues .
Two billion people who are visually affected by <unk> change — and it goes .
We have many , many problems there .
In a ideal world , we solve all of us , but we don &apos;t .
The truth is that we don &apos;t ignore all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do it , the question I think we should do — and that &apos;s the reason why we &apos;re in the economy of economics — it &apos;s saying , if we don &apos;t all do it , we really need to start asking ourselves , that problems should we solve first ?
That &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had to say , 50 billion photons to spend the next four years to improve this world , where should we spend ?
We inspected 10 of the most large challenges in the world , and just reading them . <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , education , financial policies and humiliation , <unk> and famine , <unk> movements , blood and water , and <unk> and barriers to trade .
We think these , in many ways , will shift the greatest problems of the world .
The divine question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest ?
Why should we begin to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s asking about a wrong problem .
In fact , that was the emblem of what I spoke in Davos in Idaho .
But natural , there &apos;s a problem if you ask people to focus in problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
Except the biggest of the problems that we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So the question is not to prioritize problems , they &apos;ve never engineered solutions to problems .
And it would be — naturally it makes a little bit more complicated .
For <unk> change , it would be something like Kurt .
For <unk> diseases , they could be clinics or redemption for mosquitos .
For the conflicts , they would be the rights of the U.N. , and so we could continue .
What I &apos;d like to ask you to do is you have to do , and that in 30 seconds — and I know that somehow it &apos;s something impossible — <unk> what you think are the number of success .
And also — here is , of course , where the economy goes alive — <unk> what we shouldn &apos;t do first .
What should be at the end of the list ?
Please take just 30 seconds , perhaps talking to the <unk> people , and just imagine what should be the primary priority and the less <unk> of the solutions that we have for the greatest problems of the world .
The surprising thing about this process — of course , I mean , I would be delighted — I just have 18 minutes today telling you a important amount of my time , not ?
I &apos;d like to propose , and I &apos;m going to think about this process , and that &apos;s what we really did .
And also highly recommend , and I &apos;m sure that we also have these arguments later , to think , how do we prioritize really ?
Since then , you have to ask one , why never had a list like this before ?
And one reason is that the instability is <unk> <unk> .
Nobody wants to do it .
Of course , all organizations would want to be at the highest one list like that .
But also all the organizers would not be at the highest .
And there are many more &quot; &quot; no numbers &quot; &quot; that number one , it &apos;s logical not to want a list like this .
60 years ago , there &apos;s the U.N. , and yet it doesn &apos;t have done a basic list of the big things that we can do in the world , and said , what should we do first ?
This doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t have to prioritize — each decision is a obligation , so despite all of us are also flourishing still , and that &apos;s not likely to be as good as if we really made adoption , and we &apos;re talking about it .
So what I &apos;m proposing is really saying that we had , for a long period of time , a situation where there were multiple options .
There are many , many things that we can do there , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , and the size .
We didn &apos;t have a idea .
Imagine you walk in a restaurant and you have a big letter , but you don &apos;t know what prices are .
You know you have pizza , but you don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a <unk> , they could be 1,000 dollars .
It could be a familiar pizza . Could it be a individual exercise , not ?
We wanted to know these things .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s about to do the <unk> <unk> — it &apos;s about putting the prices of these topics .
And so basically , this was the process of the <unk> <unk> .
We took 30 of the best universes in the world , three than every area .
And so we had three of the best universes of the planet writing about <unk> change .
What can you do ? What &apos;s going to be your cost ? And what &apos;s the best thing to do ?
The same with hungry diseases .
Three of the best experts say , what can we do ?
What will the price be ?
What should we do about that , and what would the result be ?
And so on .
So we took some of the best worlds in the world , including the best faiths in the world , including three Nobel laureates , put in <unk> in May of 2004 .
We call &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; The <unk> of the University of Cambridge decided to call them the Royal Society of economics .
And it works very well in Europe , but here not so much .
And basically what they did , it was made a priority list .
And then you ask you , why are you ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy to make me that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The theme is that obviously , if you want to know malaria , you ask a state about malaria .
If you want to know about climate , questions to a bureaucracy .
But if you want to know what the two must solve first , you can &apos;t ask any of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what they do .
<unk> .
They have that kind of unimaginable thing to say , that we should do first , and we need to do it then .
So this is the list , and this is the list I wanted to share with you .
Of course , you can also see in the web , and I &apos;m sure that we also talk about this interaction .
They were systematically used a list in which they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where they cross a radar , and we have less than a <unk> as a result .
Then they were the right projects , the good and the very good ones .
And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects that we should start to do .
I &apos;m going to start from the last way we can end up with the best projects .
These were the bad ones .
As you can see at the end of the list is the <unk> change .
This is analogous to many people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things about what people will say that shouldn &apos;t go back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why came ?
And the truth , I also tried to talk about this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;re not talking about with the lists that we &apos;re going to meet .
The reason it worked that they said this is that <unk> — or doing something more than <unk> — it &apos;s not a good business just because it &apos;s very effective .
It &apos;s not saying that there &apos;s no global warming .
It &apos;s not saying it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do for it is very little , at a very high cost .
What basically shows us , the average of all of the macroeconomic models , and that <unk> , if all the world was breaking up , would covered a hundred billion photons a year .
That &apos;s a important amount of money .
Two or three times the global help to development that we work at the Third World every year .
And to do very little .
All the model shows that it will self-assemble a $ six years .
So a guy in Bangladesh that &apos;s going to have a pretense in 2,500 can expect to be <unk> .
What &apos;s okay , but not very well .
So the idea and say , well , we spend a lot of money doing something well .
And just by giving a baseline , the U.N. estimates that by half of that amount , 75 billion dollars per year , we could solve all the major basic problems in the world .
We could give clean water , blood , basic health and education to all human beings in the planet .
So what should we ask , we want to spend twice in doing very little ?
Or half doing something extraordinarily good ?
And that &apos;s where it becomes a bad project .
It &apos;s not saying we had all the money in the world , not wanting to do it .
They didn &apos;t , that when we don &apos;t have it , it &apos;s just not our first priority .
The proper projects — I &apos;m not going to discuss all — but hungry diseases , scale of health care services — the sound for little , simply because , they , the scale of health health services is a big thing .
It was very well , but also and very , but that &apos;s very <unk> .
Again , what tells us , and suddenly we started thinking about the two sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , you show a lot of <unk> projects .
Again , patriarchy and water is extremely important , but it also costs a lot of inflammation .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four great priorities that should be , when less , the first ones that solve when we talk about how we should solve the problems of the world .
The last <unk> is malaria — treat malaria .
The census of malaria is about a couple of million people infected every year .
It could even cover a <unk> dot for the year to affect the affect .
If we &apos;ve taken a few billion dollars in the next four years , we could reduce it to half .
We could avoid death from a 50,000 people , but what perhaps is more important , we could avoid a billion people infected every year .
We combine their ability to treat many of other problems that have to deal . Of course , in the long term , also teaching global warming .
The third better is trade trafficking .
Amazingly , the model showed that if we could achieve the trade of trade , and especially <unk> the aid of the <unk> and Europe , we could basically cancel the global economy to the <unk> of one two trillion of <unk> per year , half of the so-called the Third World .
Again , we could really take 200 or 300 million people from poverty , radical and very fast , between two and five years .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second better thing would be to focus on poverty .
No nutrition in general , they have no way of treating degeneration , it &apos;s saying , the lack of <unk> .
<unk> , half of the population &apos;s population has no <unk> , y , <unk> and vitamin .
If we invested 12 billion dollars , we could do a profound proxy in that problem .
This would be the second better assumption that we could do .
And the best project would be solved in HIV / AIDS .
Typically , if we invested 27 billion dollars in the next few years , we could avoid 28 million new cancer cases .
Again , what this does and what &apos;s focused on is saying that we have two very different ways like treating HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is the inclusion .
Once , in a ideal world , we would have two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of the two or where we don &apos;t do it very well , we should , when less , say where we should invest first .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than aviation .
So I mean , what this is focused on is to say that we can do much more investing in recklessness .
<unk> for the amount of money that we spend together , we can do it well in treatment , and 10 times more in implementation .
So again , we need to focus on precaution more than treatment , as first choice .
What this does is that we really need to think about our priorities .
Now , I &apos;d like you to look at your list of <unk> and say , look right ?
How do you do that ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going
Well , <unk> , one of the things is new change .
I find a lot of people who think it &apos;s very , very unlikely that we did that .
We should also make habitable change , if there &apos;s no other reason , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But naturally , we don &apos;t forget all of the <unk> .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to tell you is that if we focus in problems , we focus on the most right .
In those that we can do very much more than well .
And I think , the truth — Thomas <unk> , one of the <unk> participants , he explained very , very well .
One of the things that people throve , and that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the impacts of <unk> change , people will be much , much richer .
Even the most penile impacts of the U.N. is not only the most important ones in the United States .
They estimated that a average person in the developing world in <unk> will be so rich as we are today .
And much more likely , it will be two to four times richer than we are in them .
And naturally , we will be even richer than that .
But the question is , when we talk about saving people , helping people in Bangladesh in <unk> , we &apos;re not talking about a poor multiverse .
We &apos;re talking about a very wealthy hamburger .
And so the real topic , naturally , what is saying , we want to spend a lot of money to help a little bit , a hundred years ago , a very rich <unk> ?
Or we want to help poor people , in these times in Bangladesh , who really needs help , and who can help really effectively ?
Or as I said <unk> , imagine that they were rich — as it happens — a rich Chinese , a wealthy <unk> , a wealthy <unk> in the <unk> thinking about 2005 and saying , &quot; &quot; How did you care so much about helping me a little bit with this underlying change subject , and if you cared so little to help my grandmother and my spouse , who could have helped it so much ? &quot; &quot; So I think what really tells us why we need to put our priorities in order .
Even if you don &apos;t agree with a typical way of seeing this problem .
Of course , that &apos;s fundamentally because the categorical change has a very good pictures .
You know we have &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — it seems great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense I want to see , right , but I don &apos;t think Sean &apos;s going to choose the <unk> <unk> in his next movie singing <unk> in Tanzania or something like that . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t stop for a movie .
So in many ways , I think that <unk> <unk> and all the discussions about globalization is a defenses of boring problems .
To make sure that it &apos;s not just to make us feel well , but we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
It &apos;s not going to do the things that have the biggest verbal compares , but it &apos;s also going to make places where we can actually do a bigger thing .
The other objections , I think , that are important , is that any hand I &apos;m — or we &apos;re — designing a false edit .
Of course we need to do all of us in a ideal world — it would be completely <unk> .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
In 1970 , the developed world decided that we were going to spend faster than we did , now , that in 1970 in countries in developing countries .
Because our help went to half .
It doesn &apos;t seem that we &apos;re in the way to solve all the big problems .
Likewise , people also said , but what is the war of the Serengeti ?
You know , we spend 100 billion photons , so we don &apos;t spend that to do the good thing in the world .
I &apos;m scrambling .
If some of you can talk to <unk> to do that , it &apos;s okay .
But naturally the whole subject is saying , that if you had another 100 billion dollars , we still wanted to spend a lot of the best possible way , not ?
So the real problem , it &apos;s beginning to start again and think about what the right skills are .
I should mention briefly , is this really the right list ?
You know , when you ask the best <unk> of the world , you &apos;re actually just asking the white and old men of the United States .
And they &apos;re not necessarily a great way to look at the entire world .
So we invited 80 young young people across the world so that they <unk> the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying in college , and they spoke English .
Most of them were , first , of parents in terms of asylum .
They had the same material , but they could get a lot of the subject of the discussion , how they really did , to draw their own lists .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with consistency and disease in the highest and <unk> change at the end .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
There were many other <unk> and college students and different things .
They all had as a result of the same list .
And that gave me a big hope , really to say that I think there &apos;s a way behind it to start thinking about our priorities . And say , what &apos;s the most important world in the world ?
Of course , in a ideal world , we would love to do everything .
But if we don &apos;t all do it , we can start to think about where we started ?
I see the <unk> <unk> as a process .
We did in 2004 , and we expect to get a lot more people , to get a lot better information in 2008 , 2013 .
<unk> the right way to the world , but also beginning to think about political Pan-Africanism .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t make the things that we can gain with a high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but we do great things where we can do a big , low cost , right now . At the end of the day , you can be in <unk> with the discussion of how we can really predict , but we have to be honest and French to say , if there are some things that we do , we have others we don &apos;t do .
If we worry a lot about some things , we end up not concerned about others .
So I hope that this is helping us to establish better growth , and think about how we work better to the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I walked out of the house without keys .
He just got home to visit a friend on the other side of the city because that temperature would be the two scales . I was very cold .
And I was in the trenches , looking at the pockets and I realized that I didn &apos;t have the keys .
In fact , I could see you on the bathtub on the truck table , where I left them .
But they were all closed .
I couldn &apos;t take it night in my friend &apos;s house because in the morning , I had a visit to Europe and needed to take the brake and the suitcase .
So , brace and Death <unk> <unk> a ski truck and breakfast on the window for enraged .
I &apos;m going to cost a lot of money but not more than a <unk> at the middle of the night .
Well , I give neuroscience to neuroscience .
Elon <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> rate , the seeds of adrenalin , and the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
So , the next morning when I took me out of sleep , I worried about the <unk> , and the dates that I was going to have in Europe had the <unk> mind .
And until I got to the <unk> file , I didn &apos;t tell me that I forgot the passport .
So I went down quickly to home , with snow and ice , in 40 minutes , I got the passport , and I went back to the grocery , and I went back to the time , but I took my seat to the other person , but I got my seat to the other person .
Or , in the case that they were bad things , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to do that .
And he told me , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And he told me , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going
It was something that took out of the Goldman <unk> psychologist who wrote about this for a few years ago , and it also calls them to die .
If you look at a group of experts , you get a team of experts who try to determine what happened , not ?
Well , in terms of death , as it explained to Danny , and then try to determine what you can do .
What I want to talk to you about today is what we can do .
Some things are clear , others aren &apos;t so much .
I &apos;m going to start for the course .
<unk> places around the house for the things they lose easily .
Well , this looks like common sense , and that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
There &apos;s a structure of the brain , called the hippocampus that evolved for hundreds of thousands of years to remember the basis of important things , and it &apos;s the steel , where you can catch , where you live the temperate tribes and enemy .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain .
In fact , there was someone who made the experiment to stain his sense of the <unk> of the <unk> .
But it works well with things that don &apos;t move too much and not with things that move .
So there are some place for keys .
For the router , a specific loop . The bars of reading , in a specific table .
If you take a place , and if you &apos;re <unk> the things you &apos;re going to be in your place when you look at it .
And when we travel ? It &apos;s a photo of the mobile .
You put a email with the photo to come back to the deer .
These sounds clear things .
So remember that when we &apos;re low stress , the brain is intact .
<unk> is poison and <unk> the mind .
It &apos;s in recognizing that low stresses are not going to be able to give the best of you and you should establish some system .
I &apos;m going to tell you that when you &apos;re faced to a medical decision .
We &apos;re all going to be in a moment in a situation that we &apos;re going to do .
And what I want to talk about .
And I &apos;m going to show you a lot of ways that we have to do , or any decision that we have to do is to make it happen .
Suppose you &apos;re going to the doctor and this says , &quot; &quot; I have the results of testing and it &apos;s got a little bit high . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
You know that high cholesterol is going to be <unk> .
And you &apos;re going to think that having high cholesterol is not very good . And the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to prescribe a drug is likely to understand these stereotypes and you know that they &apos;re one of the drugs .
You would like to ask a statistic , and you &apos;d like to do a lot of people .
It &apos;s the number necessary to treat ( Music ) What is the heck ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to take it drug before they help a person .
And you think , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s about statistics is that ?
The number should be one . My doctor wouldn &apos;t pay me something that I don &apos;t help .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work like that .
We don &apos;t know exactly the underlying devices .
<unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs work between 30 percent and 50 percent of cases .
So the <unk> in case of the most prescribed dystopia that you think is ?
How many people have to take it before they help someone ?
And this second results that we have to do is be able to be able to do that .
I really <unk> the data .
And think about it .
In the case of this drug , we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do something .
And they include terrible things . Give it in muscles and <unk> , <unk> <unk> — but think , &quot; &quot; One five percent . I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to go to me .
You have 15 times more likely than the drug is supposed to give you .
I &apos;m not saying if you should take it out or not .
You just should have this conversation with your physician .
You have to have access to this information to be able to talk about this information .
I think that I &apos;m talking about this number to surprise this number , but in reality , the computer is going to be able to be able to do that .
It &apos;s a <unk> , the accretion of the <unk> of cancer , the Peers is 48 .
Yes : There are to be 48 surgeries for each person who help .
And the side effects in this case give 50 percent of patients .
<unk> concerns , <unk> <unk> , <unk> fever .
So the idea of being dying for the conversation .
The ideal is not having to create all of this at the moment .
There &apos;s also to think about issues like life quality .
They &apos;re things that we need to think about now and talk to family and loved people .
Remember : low stress , and one of the things that happens at that moment is that if you follow a lot of systems .
Evolution gives it explanation .
So if the body grows in these things , and we don &apos;t respond quickly , we don &apos;t respond fast .
Of course , one of the things that boils out as he showed Danny <unk> and his colleagues .
So we need to train to think flexibly in this kind of situation .
I think the most important thing is that we all have flaws .
Right now we &apos;re going to be wrong .
The idea is to think <unk> in what these teams can be , to establish systems that can undermine the damage or just avoid those bad things to stay .
Going to that night with snow in Manchester , when I came back from the journey with the window of the house inside and a easy code to remember .
They &apos;re not entirely organized .
Good day !
Are you right ?
Anybody ? No . Well , nothing .
&quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; In Arabic . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot;
He came to look like a little bit , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , I &apos;m going to have a lot of time .
&quot; &quot; Come , you see , the <unk> of this ! &quot; &quot; He said the carpenter .
It seemed embarrassed by having to talk to me , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do .
Just a word did that a young man who had a stolen man , who had been able to be able to do it , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going
How can you talk about that ?
At that moment I started thinking .
And he gave me a lot of time .
How do we get here ?
Right now .
Despite all of all , it &apos;s not the same thing .
And we &apos;re going to do that , or we &apos;re going to be in college and we &apos;re talking about work . It &apos;s not a language that we use .
But we have another more important reality .
And there are studies that are optimistic that to master other languages that we &apos;re going to do .
When he started writing in Arabic , he started writing in Arabic .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you about all of their ideas , their imagination , and with ideas .
And when he started writing in English , he was a <unk> , and he was a <unk> .
When you read their writings in English , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to do that .
We can feel that it &apos;s the same person in the world .
Secondly , it turns out that it &apos;s killing its language .
This reality <unk> the societies developed .
The <unk> , the French , the ideologues , the ideologues , the ideologues .
That advanced thought still didn &apos;t come to us , but we &apos;d like to get that world , and we &apos;d like to achieve that world .
In fact , it was a very important thing to achieve that developed world , like <unk> , <unk> and others , who took their tongue to their language as they produced , <unk> <unk> as a therapist .
He agreed to her .
Because if we take any microbial product we know it &apos;s not a local product .
Nobody would say it was a local product .
They would be able to be consumers , vulnerable consumers , and they were going to be able to be able to be able to do that .
There are specific senses , and there are specific senses .
Language is not one , two or three words or knees on front .
Or if a child gets up and says , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; you lived when people were on the street saying &quot; &quot; <unk> &#93; &quot; &quot; ?
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , it &apos;s better than you stop and stop talking about you .
What I mean is that those expressions provide a specific appreciation .
I have a friend who speaks blunt that he thought about a French .
Once I asked him that it would be all .
And I said , &quot; &quot; All right , but I &apos;ve ever spent the entire night trying to translate it .
We want it to not tell it to her husband , and it &apos;s normal that he doesn &apos;t understand ; his way to think about it is different .
She said , &quot; &quot; He listens to me , and one night , I try to translate it so that I could feel what I feel when I listened to <unk> . &quot; &quot; The jingling tried to translate this : &quot; ... My hands and <unk> ... &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the lens : ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the lens : ( Laughter )
( Applause ) Well , what did we do to protect Arabic language ?
We tried to engage the Jewish society , and we tried to be able to do that .
Even though many people said , &quot; &quot; Why cares ?
It spits out this issue and <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the problem ! &quot;
In the campaign to preserve the Arab <unk> the following mate : &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to have a lot of money . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t want to do it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! No ! No ! We don &apos;t accept this or I &apos;m crazy ! &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t use that style because that way doesn &apos;t understand us .
And when someone speaks to me , I hate the Arab .
We said — ( Applause ) We said that we want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspiration and day day .
In order to see how we think about how we think about how we think .
After that , we rely on photos of young young and girls met with Arabic characters .
They &apos;re from teens and girls .
We are very <unk> .
And the thing that says , &quot; &quot; Hey , you used a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopted the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can tell you what you want , but they have a more beautiful word and that <unk> better with reality .
I &apos;m going to just say &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell
And what you think is that they have authority about us , in which the language comes to language .
Compassion in the spinal language is the way .
Let &apos;s start right now .
One novel could make us another global time .
It could take the Arab again again .
But we have to know it , and I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s solutions , and that we have to be part of it .
In short , what can you do right now ?
Let &apos;s look at — <unk> , who is <unk> ?
Please do it , even though my time ends out , I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
But don &apos;t write in Arabic with <unk> blind characters with numbers .
( Applause ) It &apos;s a <unk> ! It &apos;s not a language !
They were going to walk into a virtual world with virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back to the world and <unk> .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
The guys identify first to their father .
So when my daughter , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; This is Honey , my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Enough <unk> <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you &apos;re going to be there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you &apos;re going to be there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you &apos;re going to be there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you &apos;re going to be there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m
What is happening in the mind of baby ?
If you ask this 30 years ago , most people , psychologists , would say this baby is irrational , <unk> , <unk> — that wouldn &apos;t have to tell the perspective of another person or couldn &apos;t understand a process of cause .
In the last 20 years , development science has reignited this theory .
In a way , we believe that the thought of this baby is like the thought of the most noble scientists .
I &apos;ll give you an example of this .
One thing I could be thinking about this baby , which could be happening in his mind , is to be able to detect what &apos;s happening in the mind of another baby .
Finally and cable , one of the hardest things for all of us is to try to decode what other people think and feel .
And maybe the hardest thing is to understand that what others think and feel is not the same thing that we think and feel .
What &apos;s so much about politics can tell the hard thing to do this to some people .
We wanted to know whether babies and small children could understand this idea as complex about other people .
The question is , how can we ask them ?
The guys don &apos;t talk , and if we asked a three-year-old child that tells us what you think , we only get a act of sports thinking , we get and things in the style .
How can we then ask them ?
It turns out that the arrow was the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , one of my students , and most of me , we gave babies two meals with food : one with a handheld owl and another with <unk> <unk> .
All the baby , even in <unk> , you like the <unk> and you don &apos;t like the banjo .
( Laughter ) After , what made <unk> was to test food from two directions .
And he had to enjoy or not what he did .
Half of the time , he had to love the <unk> and not the angel — like any baby or normal person .
But the other half , it would take a little bit of baby and say , &quot; &quot; Daddy , I spell .
I started the priest . Whoom . &quot; &quot; And then he got a tweets , and he said , &quot; &quot; Daddy , <unk> , <unk> .
I tried the <unk> . Disgust , <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s saying , it was like you liked the opposite of what you liked the baby .
We did this with two and 18 months .
And then <unk> would take his hand and say , &quot; Give me a little bit ? &quot;
The question was , let &apos;s leave the babies what you love them or her ?
The startling thing was that the <unk> of 18 months , who end up walking and talking , they gave the <unk> if you liked the <unk> and the rabbi , if I liked the banjo .
On the other hand , the two months of 15 months caught to her if he felt like I liked the baby , as if they couldn &apos;t understand it .
And after I looked at a long mouse , they asked tweets , what I thought I &apos;d like to want to all the world .
So there are two data data in this .
On one side it &apos;s that 18 months already have to match this important part of human nature : that we don &apos;t all want the same .
It &apos;s more , they understand that they should act to help other people to do what they want .
And more interestingly , it &apos;s that the kids of 15 months don &apos;t do this ; what suggests that 18 months learned this profound act of being human in three months that are separating them from the ages of 15 months .
So babies know more and learn more than we thought to now .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that did in the last 20 years showing this done .
What you can ask now is : Why do kids learn so much ?
And how is it possible to learn so much in so little time ?
I mean , the first view , the faces seem pretty much .
And in many occasions , they &apos;re worse than usual , because we have to use a lot of time and energy just in living alive .
If we design evolution to look at this mystery of why we lose so much time to be concerned about the baby , it turns out that there &apos;s a answer that we &apos;re going to do .
If you look at various different species , not just other primates like us , but also other <unk> , birds , even <unk> like the <unk> or the <unk> , it turns out there &apos;s relationships between the duration of childhood , and the <unk> size of the brain and intelligence and the frailty of species .
One example of this takes it from these birds that you can see here .
On a band we have the <unk> of New Jersey .
The color and other <unk> , axes , bridges , <unk> , are very clever birds .
In certain senses , they &apos;re so clever like chimpanzees .
And this is a very studied bird that has learned to use tools to get food .
On the other hand , we have our so-called a domestic facility .
<unk> , like the bars , molds and synagogues , are dumb like stone .
They &apos;re very good to perform big , but they &apos;re not very good to do anything else .
It turns out that the baby &apos;s shoes from New Jersey , the <unk> , the <unk> .
It depends on that their moms will undergo the worms in the mouth to the two years of life , which is a long time in the short life of a bird .
However , the Saudis are adult in the face of a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason that the color ends on the doors of the scientific journals while the <unk> end up in the <unk> pole .
There &apos;s something in the long childhood that seems to be related to knowledge and learning .
What would we have for this ?
Some animals , like the crabs , seem to be designed to do something very well .
So the <unk> are very good to perform big in a specific environment .
Other creatures , like the color , are not particularly good doing anything particular , but they &apos;re very good to learn the norms of different environments .
And of course , we humans are very far away in that distribution .
We have more big brains with relationship to our body , much more than any other animal .
We need smarter , more patents , we can learn more , we can survive in many more environments : we have Eve throughout the planet and even face space .
And our babies and children depend on us for much longer than the babies other species .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) So less until the 23 , we followed these worms in their open mouths .
All right , why do we look at this substance ?
One idea is that that strategy , the strategy of learning , is a very powerful and strong way to get back in this world , but it &apos;s got a great <unk> .
It turns out that until you learn everything , if you &apos;re <unk> .
Wouldn &apos;t it be good that you get a <unk> and be thinking , &quot; Could I use a <unk> or a launch ? What will be better ? &quot;
I &apos;d better know all that before you get the <unk> .
And the way evolution dismissed this problem was , it seems to be , with a job division .
So we have this period of time when we &apos;re completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . It &apos;s just learning .
And then , of adults , we can take that that we learn from babies and children and put it into practice to get back around the world .
A way to think about this is that babies and small children are like the colony of <unk> and evolution of human species .
These are the <unk> people who study , those who only have to go , learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and sanitation .
We have to take all those ideas that we learn from children and placing them in practice .
Another way to see it is , instead of thinking about the baby and children like grisly adults , think of them as beings in a different development state in the same species ; like the <unk> and the <unk> , but the babies would be the <unk> that thanked by the garden to explore , and we would be the graves in our short-term path of adults .
If this is right , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution shows us that this is , that children are to learn , we can expect that they &apos;re a very powerful learning devices .
And in fact , the brain of a baby seems to be the most powerful learning computer in the planet .
Even though true computers are improving a lot .
There &apos;s going to be a revolution in our way to understand the machines of learning .
And all of the causes of this man , <unk> Thomas <unk> , a <unk> and mathematician of the 18th century .
Amazingly , <unk> provided a mathematical application that used the theory of probability to print and describe the way scientists have discovered things in the world .
What scientists do is we plan a hypothesis , something that can start .
Then they got that hypothesis with evidence .
Experts make them change the hypothesis .
And we &apos;re going to be able to see that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to do that with new tests , and so forth .
What archeologists showed was a mathematician that could do that .
And mathematics is the basis of the best learning programs that we have today .
Ten years ago , I announced that the baby would be doing the same .
If we want to know what &apos;s going down under these beautiful brown brown blades , I think it &apos;s something very similar to it .
And I &apos;m going to show you a few years ago , and I &apos;m going to show you what I was going to do in the <unk> notes .
I think babies are doing very complicated calculations with innate probabilities that experience and so spark how the world works .
Well , this is even harder to prove .
If you ask a adult in statistics , you can feel pretty stupid .
How is it possible that children do statistics ?
To test this , we use a machine that we should call 911 <unk> .
It &apos;s a box that spreads and sound when you get a statue of it .
Using this very simple machine , in my lab , and also others , if you &apos;ve done dozens of studies about good people who are children learning about the world .
I showed just one that we did with <unk> <unk> , one of my students .
If you show you this detector probably , you &apos;d probably start to think that the shape of the magnet is placing a <unk> on the detector .
But the case is that the detector works in a very strange way .
If you put a <unk> on the detector , something you didn &apos;t think about in a beginning , the detector is worth two than three times .
Whereas if you put the <unk> on this , what would be the logical , it only activates two than six times .
So the less likely hypothesis has more clear evidence .
It seems like the strategy to adopt the object is more effective than the other .
So we explain these data to the three-year-old children , and we asked them to try .
And with security , four years ago , six years ago , they had the data and they threw the object on the detector .
There are two interesting data in this fact .
The first one , remember that they &apos;re about four years old , and they have a lot of people .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that they &apos;re learning to count ; they &apos;re learning to tell them , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
But they &apos;re still doing complex calculations that give them a measure of parole probability .
The second of the interesting thing is that they &apos;re using the evidence to get to a idea , to a hypothesis about the world , which seems like a little bit like the beginning .
In studies that we do in the lab , other similar ones , we &apos;ve shown that these four years are better than adults , given the same task .
In these conditions , children do statistics to unraveling things about the world , but scientists experience , after all , and we wanted to see if kids tried too .
That &apos;s what we normally call &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; It has been a lot of interesting studies recently that showed that these games are like a kind of experimental research program .
We show one of the <unk> Frankenstein lab .
<unk> needed new <unk> <unk> .
He showed kids that the <unk> <unk> did work and the red doesn &apos;t , besides showing them a anomaly .
What we see now is this boy being five hypotheses in two minutes of time .
Child : And so ?
Child : Just like the other side .
( Laughter ) FG : Well , the first chance .
Child : No ( Laughter ) Child : This <unk> , but this doesn &apos;t .
( Laughter ) FG : It starts to describe the experience .
Child : Why does this stick ?
( Laughter ) Child : I don &apos;t understand it .
<unk> : Scientists will recognize that face of contempt .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
<unk> : <unk> , chance 2 .
Child : So it must be .
Child : Oh ... It can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) FG : Now here &apos;s the following idea .
He asked the <unk> that he &apos;s going to put it out of the other .
It didn &apos;t work .
Child : Oh , it &apos;s because light is just going to here , not here .
Under this box there &apos;s electricity , but this doesn &apos;t .
FG : Well , that would be the fourth chance .
Child : Now yeah .
If you get four marathons .
If you put four <unk> in this , it &apos;s spreading and two to follow the other .
FG : Well , that &apos;s the <unk> hypothesis .
This child is — it &apos;s a very little and <unk> kid , but <unk> discovered that it &apos;s a very typical child .
If you look at how to play children , if you ask you that you wonder something , what they do is experience .
Twenty years of the age of four .
Well , what do you feel like this kind of creature ?
What if you feel one of these boots that can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
If we go to the theory of psychologists and philosophers , many say that babies and children are aware , or even that they &apos;re not alone .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and children are more aware of adults .
This is what we know about how adult consciousness works .
Consciousness and attention of a adult looks at a focus .
What happens in adults is that when we decide something is important or relevant , we &apos;ve got attention .
The consciousness about what we &apos;re looking at is <unk> and intense , whereas the rest of the rest of it is spreading .
We also know how this is happening in the brain .
When we pay attention to something , the <unk> part of the brain , the part that makes actions , allows a signal that makes a little part of the brain if <unk> becomes more psychotic , better to learn ; and it turns up activity in the rest of the brain .
We have such a very focused attention , <unk> at purpose .
If you look at the babies and children , you see something very different .
I think babies and children seem to have a more similar insight to a <unk> .
A couple of babies and kids are very limiting attention to something else .
But it gives you very well to have a lot of information in many sources .
And if you look at their brains , what we see is that they &apos;re <unk> of neurotransmitters that inhibit learning and the obligation , and that the <unk> still doesn &apos;t lead to cable .
So when we say that babies and children have problems to pay attention , what really means is that it costs them not to pay attention .
They would never get rid of the interesting things that you could say something for just looking at what matters .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness that we should expect from those boots that are designed to learn .
If we want to think about a way to feel that kind of child consciousness as adults , I think the best way is to think about cases where we &apos;re in a new situation where we haven &apos;t been never yet yet , or when we &apos;re going to a city for the first time .
In cases of consciousness , consciousness doesn &apos;t fall , but it turns out that in three days in Paris there are more consciousness and experiences that in every month around the house , walking , speaking , <unk> as a <unk> .
For sure , that coffee , that magnificent coffee that we take below , actually mimic the effect of the <unk> of the baby .
So how is a baby ?
It &apos;s like being <unk> , in Paris , for the first time , after it weighs three <unk> times .
( Laughter ) A wonderful feeling , but that &apos;s supposed to be 85 to 3 o &apos;clock . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s okay to be adult .
I don &apos;t mean a lot about the magnificent ones that are the baby .
It &apos;s okay to be adult .
We can do things like avoiding the shoes or crossing the road alone .
And it has sense that we make a lot of effort in making babies think about how adults .
But if what we want is to be like those <unk> , having the open mind , being open to learning , imagination , creativity , innovation — maybe at least sometimes , we should make adults think a little bit like children .

These are simple objects : ears , keys , <unk> , lens .
These are the things that the victims of genocide in Botswana are the things that we have .
We all are used to these <unk> and ordinary objects .
And the fact that some victims have taken a spiritual objects like the sleeve or the teeth of teeth is a signal that they didn &apos;t have a idea of what it was going to do .
They used to tell you that they would be shared , and they were going to be able to do that .
These objects recover from common <unk> of my land , and while we talk about , they &apos;re pumping bodies from the new common pits that have been found 20 years after war .
And it &apos;s perhaps the biggest <unk> , and it &apos;s perhaps the biggest side of the world .
Over the four years of conflict that triggered the principles of the 1990s , one 30,000 citizens , a teacher most , disappeared , probably killed and other 100,000 were <unk> during the operation operation .
The poorest were killed , well in the first days of war , or well face at the end of conflict , they were left in the <unk> army .
The international skier responded without <unk> by humanities against humanity and genocide .
<unk> is the therapeutic and <unk> destruction of a ecologist , political , <unk> and racial .
The <unk> is so much the killing .
And I &apos;m going to show you how the source of property , of cultural heritage , and basically of any sign of its existence , is that it &apos;s not the same thing .
The genocide is not just prevalent ; it &apos;s the denial of identity .
There are always hints , there &apos;s no perfect <unk> .
It &apos;s always been aware of the <unk> that spend more than their body bodies or our secular and weak compass .
These objects get rid of a lot of common pits and the aim of the wiring of objects is a unique process of identification than they disappear in the first act of genocide in Europe from the Holocaust .
No body should stay without finding or without <unk> , and it &apos;s not the same thing .
Once they recovered these objects that victims have led to their <unk> <unk> , they <unk> themselves and they get them back .
They &apos;re sitting in plastic bags like the ones who see in ISIS , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to do that .
They &apos;re located as tools that are in the visual wiring of victims , but also as valuable evidence in the war rankings , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
Sometimes it &apos;s called the Iranians to identify physical wisdom , but visual explanations is a difficult , interdependent process and <unk> .
Once you get , doctors and lawyers end up to be aware of the narrative .
Many of them hate , even though they don &apos;t create it or just spread out of the sight and the mind .
A few years ago , I decided to photograph every <unk> object to create a simple visual memorial that the dancers are <unk> .
Now , I think I &apos;m going to be able to convince myself that I &apos;d like to promote the <unk> without the <unk> .
And in this case , somewhere can recognize objects or at least that the photos are like permanent memory , and <unk> and <unk> than happened .
The photograph is empathy and the familiar of these volatile objects .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , one of you , if you want , and the result is the most similar thing to a threshold .
When you get <unk> to the <unk> , you &apos;re going to get the coronary body and these ordinary objects .
In all its genes , these objects are testing for identity from the victims of the streets that those people were born with .
Thank you very much .

A few years ago , I decided to follow the footprints of the great American philosopher , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There are some things I learned with these <unk> challenges .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that the months were not going to show me , forgotten , if it wasn &apos;t that time was much more memorable .
This belongs to my challenge to take a picture every day for a month .
He would never have been so <unk> .
I also understood that I was going to be able to do this .
For sure , the secret is not to sleep .
But let &apos;s see your novel .
It &apos;s terrible .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m a politician . &quot;
No . If I want to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer .
I promise that by making small and sustainable changes , it &apos;s more likely to keep them forever .
In fact , they &apos;re very fun .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to share my photo .
Is this picture ?
Because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your cameras .
In all , my interest on photography started when I could my first digital camera at 15 years .
He went to my passion earlier by the impression , but it was a little different , because by using the camera the process was more well in planning .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process finishes when I get the <unk> .
For me the photograph had more to be in the best place , in the better moment .
It seemed like anyone could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process begins to invoke the <unk> .
It &apos;s like this : a lesion in a very burned road .
But it has a unexpected gyrus .
And yet , it keeps a level of reality .
Or photos like these — dark and <unk> , but all of the common goal to keep the level of realism .
When I &apos;m honest , I say it was <unk> .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can be really captured but I always want you to look like it was captured in a way like a picture .
Some of you have to think about a moment to discover the trick .
So this has more than seeing a idea that would capture a really .
But what is the trick that makes them feel real ?
Do you have to see the details or the colors ?
Do you have to see with light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But at the end of it is our way of interpreting the world and how it can be beneficial in a 2D surface .
It &apos;s actually not true of whether it &apos;s real but what we think it &apos;s real .
So I think the perceptions are very simple .
I see it as a <unk> of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and the ships to create a alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three physical physical objects , something that we all can relate to to live in a three-dimensional world .
But <unk> in a way can create something that &apos;s still three-dimensional ; as there is there .
But at the same time , we know that there can &apos;t exist .
So we will play our brain because the brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that that really doesn &apos;t have sense .
And I see the same process to <unk> photos .
It really consists of merging different realities .
So the things that make a photograph look like an philosophical picture , I think these are those ones that we don &apos;t even think ; the things that are going on in our life will resonate .
But when we put pictures , it &apos;s really important to have in account this , because otherwise it seems rare in a way .
So I &apos;d like to say that there are three simple approaches that follow to get realistic outcomes .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But <unk> , you can create something like this .
So the first note is that the <unk> photos must have the same perspective .
Second , the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light .
And these two images are with these requirements ; they were taken at the same time and with the same kind of light .
The third point is to make it impossible to do where they start and end the different images with a perfect footprint .
It has to be impossible to say how it made the image in reality .
Making the color , the contrast and the color in the boots that are between the different images , adding spectacular debris like depth depth , fuzzy colors and noise , separating the limits between different images , and we actuate it to look like a picture , despite the fact that a sound image can actually have hundreds of layers .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) It could think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part is what was manipulated .
But this image is completely designed by pictures of different places .
Now , I think it &apos;s easier to create a place that finds it , because one doesn &apos;t need to compromise the ideas that have in the head .
But this requires a lot of planning .
And as I thought this idea in the winter , I knew that I had several months to try , to find the different places for the mouths of the <unk> .
For example , fish was captured in a way to catch it .
The back is different anatomy .
The <unk> part was entombed in a stone center .
And yeah , I got red to the house of the island of the island so that it spits out more dirty .
So to get a real outcome , I think it takes planning .
You always start with a good , a idea .
Then there are those different pictures .
And here every piece is very well thought .
If you do a good job to take the photos the result can be very beautiful and rather challenging .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that &apos;s limiting us is our imagination .
Thank you .

In this slide , you have to take their age on the <unk> pedal .
After the tablet , we got out of the map .
It &apos;s a technique that we &apos;re using around the world .
And the distribution distribution is completely different .
It changes our model of how the critical period of time .
We had to establish a group of control , and we had to make a lot of information .
But we wondered that paper is a lot of things .
And another group that has only been showing a audio of a audio that was going to be a little bit more than a few years ago .
What you see here is the result of the audio , and it &apos;s the result of the audio .
It &apos;s six months old .
