( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) <unk> , the <unk> . In behalf of Al , the girl .
( Laughter ) I noticed a family class .
His father was five years old when she lost his father , but when I noticed it , he was already a business man .
If their kids were children or girls , they were going to go to school .
So I guess I was lucky .
My mother was <unk> 16 times .
Of the 16 <unk> , we &apos;re living five .
You can imagine what I had to spend when it was a kid .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be transported to the toilet , or kids being taken to a meadow .
At that moment , when I finished high school , I wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I took my education , but I wanted to go to college .
Later , in my country , there was no excuse for women in the villages so , even though they accepted me in medical school , I couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father sent me to America .
I saw America .
And I took my studies .
As I finished my education , Russia invaded my country .
You know ? When I was finishing my way , I realized what was happening to my family and my country .
I spent months , years , and I didn &apos;t have news .
My family found it in a camp camp .
So as I finished the studies , I brought my family to America .
I wanted that they were saving .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I listened to the news , when I remained the news in my country , I feared my heart .
I wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go because there was no place for me .
She had a good job .
It was a professor in a university .
It was good .
She had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
So , it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back to my throat .
So I &apos;m going to go to the camp camp .
And when I went to the camp camp camp , there was seven million and a half million refugees .
Of course , about 90 percent were women and children , most of the men or dying in war or they were on it . And they know ?
When I did the adverse reports , I looked at things that don &apos;t imagine .
I saw a villain with five and eight children , sitting sitting , crying , without knowing what to do .
I saw a new woman who didn &apos;t have where I go , without studies , not income , not a place where they live .
I watched kids who lost their parents , their <unk> and that with 10 or 12 years ago , they had to take their families , their family heads and try to protect their siblings , their mother and children .
The situation was absolutely miserable .
My heart would be used by my people and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
At that point , it becomes a impulse .
At that point , I felt like , what can I do for these people ?
How can I help them ?
Am you a person , what can I do for them ?
But at that point , I knew that education changes my life .
He <unk> me . He got a position .
I trust trust . Show me a career .
She helped me take my family to take my family to another country , so they were saving it .
And at that moment I knew that what was supposed to provide my people was education and health and that &apos;s what I tried to do .
But think was it easy ?
Well , not , because women didn &apos;t have access to education .
Also , after the <unk> of Russia in Afghanistan , people didn &apos;t trust anyone .
It was very hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who are I ?
Somebody who comes from the United States .
Somebody who has got here .
Did you trust me ? Of course .
So what really needed it was to win trust in this community .
How am I going to do it ?
I went , I was sorry , I looked and I looked at it .
I did questions .
At the end , I found a man .
I was 80 .
It was a <unk> .
I went to his shop in the airport , and I showed him the proposal , &quot; &quot; I want to become a teacher . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I went to a teacher .
And I looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , crazy , how do you think I can be a professor ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And finally , I started with a class in his lab , he went to the voice .
In this year , we had 25 <unk> schools , 15 children in school , and it was amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
Of course , we were doing our work , forming teachers . It &apos;s going to be in rights of women , human rights , democracy and laws . We have all sorts of shape . And one day , you know that , if you &apos;re going to do it .
One day , I was in the office in <unk> , <unk> , and I was in the office .
And suddenly , I saw that all my personal staff was going to the room , and I closed the doors and they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , you do ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk>
You have fear . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is on game .
But as a leader , you have to keep <unk> .
You have to keep <unk> and show the muscles .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And those people were <unk> in mass to my office .
So I invited them to the office .
They lived . They were nine , nine Taliban .
They were the most poignant men that can see before .
( Laughter ) People with a suitcase , black black , black black , and went into mass in my office .
And we invited us to sit and take a tea .
They did . They didn &apos;t have to take it .
And of course , the voice of voice who used a lot of fear , and I was fully affected .
But at the same time , I &apos;m very interested .
And of course , in that moment , you &apos;re already looking at the head of the head for a black girl , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I
The only thing I saw was the eyes .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; What does it do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What does you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What
Do you know that school is fueled to women ?
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And you know ? I know , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; Well , where &apos;s the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I looked at me to face and said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s girls . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s girls . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s girls .
You see some students . They all learn the Koran , the holy book .
You know ? The Koran says that if you study the holy book , women can be good husbands , and they can restore their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I say one thing : That &apos;s how it &apos;s like these people . ( Laughter ) So that moment , they were talking about it .
They talked between them and said , &quot; &quot; Come , let &apos;s do it . &quot; &quot; And you know ? So Hasbro got over and took a candle and laughed .
And so my personal staff has dropped mass to my office .
They were dead dead .
I didn &apos;t know why I didn &apos;t kill me .
I didn &apos;t know why I didn &apos;t take me with them .
All of all , everybody was ready to see .
All happy , and of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) Of course , I &apos;m afraid of being alive .
But also , by following the fall of the glaciers , when <unk> had the power was another story .
We met in <unk> and we taught 80 girls , three <unk> students , which we started without dinner .
In the fall of the glaciers , we were in the country and we open a school after another .
We launched education education for women .
We took clinics without stop .
We work with women and children .
It &apos;s about cardiovascular health .
We <unk> how many kinds of ways can imagine .
I was very happy . I was delighted with my work .
And one day , when I went to four educators and with a guard , I spoke to the north of Cyrus , suddenly , again , I fell in the middle of the road , I got 19 kids .
In <unk> , they put the road .
I was told to my driver that happened and he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s nothing to see with you . &quot; &quot; He shared my name and said , &quot; &quot; I can tell you . &quot; &quot; My mother came back and said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
What you want ? &quot; &quot; They said nothing and called me .
At that moment , women were yelling inside the car .
I &apos;m very affected and I say , &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m very affected .
This time , they &apos;re going to kill everyone .
I didn &apos;t have any doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes , you take the forces from everything you believe and what we do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
Trust you in your waist and you can go through that .
So I grew up on one side of the car .
My leg would come and get out of the car .
I said , &quot; &quot; Where can I help them ? &quot; &quot; You know what they respond to me ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who &apos;s .
We know where it goes .
It goes every day on another place .
In women , <unk> , and also give you the opportunity to have a job .
<unk> . What about compassion ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; What about compassion ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Okay .
We know , the only thing we can do , for time when you &apos;re going to live , is <unk> a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know more . &quot; &quot; And they know what it means .
Obviously , it was a conspiracy .
So I turned up and said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go down , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I walked on the car , sat , and I said to the driver , &quot; &quot; Come back and come back to the office . &quot; &quot; So we just helped women .
We just had money to teach them to them , to send them to school , and nothing else .
When I went to the office , obviously all the educators left .
They killed their homes . Nobody would die .
My prison was the only thing I was there and I was still a voice .
I was angry , sit in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
Because we &apos;ve been offered education in the north .
Hundreds of women would come to us .
So I was sitting there , and suddenly , now , we &apos;re talking about pulses , because at that moment , one of my wonderful guys , I asked me a report .
And he called me , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And he said .
He said , &quot; &quot; No , you do . What about you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I tried to <unk> .
It was exactly what it says , I didn &apos;t believe , and she &apos;s still asking .
&quot; &quot; Okay , tell me that it &apos;s going to happen . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;ve played all the story .
So , he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next , you &apos;re going and <unk> them to them .
<unk> . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I did the same way , you know what ? They weren &apos;t there , they were a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s foot , <unk> the kidney and reaction us to stop the car .
So I took the car .
I knew , and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I saw me . &quot; &quot; And they responded , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; In a condition , you do everything I say . &quot; &quot; And they agreed .
So I took them to the mosque and to summarize , I said I was going to give teachers teachers .
Now , they &apos;re the best educators .
You learn English , they learn how to be teachers , learn it and are my salaries .
The whole areas we don &apos;t know , in the mountain zones , they come up with me . They &apos;re going on and we &apos;re going .
And we get them .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That shows education changes people .
When we educate people , they change and , in the lab , we need to work for equality .
You cannot educate women and forget of men , because men are the people who make them more difficult to women .
( Laughter ) So we started to educate them , because they must be aware of the potential of women , knowing how much potential they have , and those women can <unk> the same jobs that they have .
So we form men , and I believe profoundly .
I &apos;m going to tell you that I live in a country that was beautiful .
I just want to share this .
It was a beautiful country , beautiful and <unk> .
We &apos;re all the parts .
Women have received education : <unk> , engineers , professors — and we would be a house to another .
We didn &apos;t closed the doors .
But you know it happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of security problems .
But we still want Afghanistan from before .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now , women in Afghanistan work very , very hard .
They &apos;re <unk> . It will be <unk> .
They decided to be a doctor , again .
They decided to be a teacher and they run business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people use all their potential and all this will happen .
I want to share it with you for love , for compassion , for trust and honesty .
If you have these things , they will succeed .
We have a poet , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He said that if you have compassion and if you get love , you can <unk> the world .
And I say , we could .
And if we were in Afghanistan , I &apos;m safe to 100 percent that any can happen around the world .
Thank you , thank you , thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago I got a phone call that changed my life .
So , I was <unk> at UCLA &#93; University of California , Los Angeles <unk> in the heart of heart image .
I used to quote it was a <unk> of Los Angeles .
A old chimpanzees wise with colonoscopies and the veterans would have found them that it was a brain injury .
I wondered if I could go to Finland to look at a potential cause of heart .
It always leaves clear that the Americans in the United States are told with <unk> <unk> <unk> and high pressures that take a great way of their animals .
But sometimes , it comes to the medical community , especially for some special office , and I &apos;m going to show you a lot of people .
Now , I should try to decode brain degeneration in the case of this chimpanzees , and I &apos;ve found that the <unk> of this nuclear lion was not harmed . Here &apos;s this picture , <unk> the heart of a ritual after we lost life , in a process of veterans and doctors in which we took 700 pieces of <unk> from the arm that covers his heart .
And this procedure , which I &apos;ve been guiding in many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that jar and that glue .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you about how many of you are going to be able to deal with symptoms , diagnostics and treatments for my human patients ; for their animals .
And in the same day , at the same day , the same day happened in the Medical Medical Center and at Los Angeles Los Angeles .
And I started to see a thing .
Well , the doctors and the veterans have <unk> the same conditions in their human patients and animals : <unk> heart cancer , brain tumors , <unk> , diabetes , diabetes , <unk> , <unk> cancer , cancer cancer , cancer , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
Well , I have to give you a <unk> .
Even though I &apos;ve studied <unk> and evolutionary biology during college — I even did my degree about the theories of <unk> — learn more about the impacts between animal disease and human illness was a very necessary attention for me .
And I started asking myself how could it be , with all those facts , who never asked me to be a <unk> or a doctor who would have another perspective about one of my human patients ?
Do we have to be a <unk> conference ?
Even more , why should we be surprised ?
All doctors accept some biological connections between animals and human beings .
All the drugs that we pay , that we take or we give our families together before in a animal .
But there &apos;s a big difference between giving a animal or a drug or a human disease , and that animal developed by even the same cardiac heart , diabetes or cancer cancer .
Perhaps , part of the surprise comes from the growing transition that our world does between the existing range and not separate debris .
We listen to these kids who think that the forest grows in the trees or that the fall comes from a plant .
The human hospitals today are turning more and more in the <unk> light of technology .
And this creates a <unk> distance between human patients that are treated and the animals that live in the ocean , in the valleys and in the jungle .
But I think there &apos;s still a more profound reason : &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
The doctors and scientists accept that our species , the Homo erectus , is just a species more , not more unique than any other .
But in our surroundings , we don &apos;t just realize it .
I &apos;m going to remember myself when I hear Mozart or I see in my memoir the photos that did the Solomon Sea .
I &apos;m sorry that called human surplus , even knowing the cost of a <unk> , isolated species of seeing us as a different species , the part .
Well , but this cartoon is trying to communicate .
Now , when I see a human patient , I always ask me : What do you know the doctors of animals about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
And more : Could I make better to my human patient if you see how a human animal is ?
And here &apos;s some examples of the traits that led me to this kind of patience .
<unk> heart <unk> for fear .
It &apos;s going to be a year 2000 , the <unk> of humans found &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
It was <unk> in a personal father on the game that lost the savings of all life in a pair of fingers , in a Tuesday sanctuary .
But it turns out that this new human diagnosis was not new or fully human .
<unk> have been misdiagnosed , treat and even predicted psycho-social symptoms in animals , from monkeys to <unk> , from <unk> , from the 1950s .
How many human lives could they save if this contagious knowledge was going to the forefront of emergency doctors and <unk> ?
<unk> .
Some human patients are born themselves .
We &apos;re going to see it .
Some animals are also tied to themselves .
There are survivors that kill the favelas once and again to save .
But veterans have very specific ways and practical ways to treat and even prevent the hormones in animals that behave like this .
Wouldn &apos;t it be this provocative knowledge to the <unk> of <unk> , of parents and patients who fight with <unk> ?
And of course , it &apos;s <unk> and depression .
Sometimes , the little bit of giving the light some women in depression , sometimes in severe depression , and still in the Soviet states .
They can reject his own son , and in the extreme cases they get to the laundry .
<unk> veterans know that when you once once once , a little bit after the day , you can reject his thumbnail , and you inject it down , and in some cases , I put it to kill it .
But the veterans thought a treatment to address this stress disorder that involves the oxytocin of the dung .
Daptomycin is the hormone hormone , and it causes it to have a <unk> interest in its <unk> .
Wouldn &apos;t it be this information to get the <unk> and <unk> , of family doctors and patients who are faced to depression and mental disorders ?
Despite the promise that it &apos;s all of this , the distance between our lives are still big .
To explain it , a lot of me I &apos;m going to have to take some of some evidence .
There are doctors who can be <unk> with the professional who are not written in medical surgery .
I &apos;m referring to <unk> , <unk> and psychologists , but especially to <unk> .
Of course , most of the doctors don &apos;t have no idea that it &apos;s harder to get today in a <unk> of Copenhagen than a medical doctor , and that when we go to medical medical learning everything that &apos;s relevant to know about a species , the Homo <unk> . But the veterans must learn about health and the diseases of mammals , reptiles , reptiles , fish and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame the veterans to feel familiar with <unk> and the denial of my fellow profession .
Here &apos;s a joke of the part of the <unk> : How if it calls a character that only knows a species ?
<unk> <unk> this distance became in my passion , and I &apos;m doing it through programming as <unk> <unk> , at Ushahidi , where we invited experts in animals and biologists and our own medical team and our own <unk> team .
And through Fox Talks , where we invited the medical school school and mining to keep discussions with research about disease and hospital-acquired disorders for human patients and animals .
In <unk> Talks , participants learn how the treatment of a breast cancer in a tent can help us treat better cancer cancer from a month of child education ; how to understand the criminal emperors of a cow &apos;s cow can help us improve the treatment of a dance teacher with <unk> <unk> ; and how to understand the treatment of the decline of separation in a shepherd secret of the very nervous <unk> can serve to a child who needs to deal in the beginning of the class .
In <unk> Talks , first in America and now around the world , doctors and veterans leave their attitudes and innovate and follow as a colleagues , as the same , as doctors .
In the end of the date , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s already time that we , doctors , and we give us the veterans in a approach to the health that obeys all species .
Because it turns out that some of the best and more medical linguists are being tested by doctors who have patients who are not human .
And one of the best ways we treat the human patient is to give a lot of attention to how all other patients in the planet live , grow , sick and healthy .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) Here the key word is &quot; &quot; It was . &quot; &quot; <unk> !
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to see brain brain , as you can imagine , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now , I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m going to tell you about .
I didn &apos;t know anything about it .
In Western cultures , when you have about it , you &apos;re going to be able to see it .
Life , from a complex human , is replaced by medical data : your arteries , medical testing , the research results , the list of medicine — the list of medicine — the list of medicine .
Suddenly you become a disease with <unk> .
Doctors begin to speak a language that you don &apos;t understand .
They start the signal with your body and your arteries .
People begin to change also because they start treating disease instead of the person .
Listen , &quot; &quot; What told you the doctor ? &quot; &quot; Even before I say , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As much as so , according to questions that nobody has answer .
<unk> of the guy , &quot; &quot; Am you who ? &quot; &quot; Are you who I work with ?
Are you who studying ? Why do I study love ? Is it creative ?
You ask , &quot; &quot; What did I do to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; Ask , &quot; &quot; Can I change something in my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; Ask , &quot; &quot; Is there something that can do ?
Is there any other option ? &quot; &quot; And of course , doctors are the good guys in all these cases , because they &apos;re very professional and engaged with cure .
But they &apos;re also very used to treat patients , so I would say that sometimes they lose the perspective that for you is a coat and that you become literally in a patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; what wait . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What wait . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; you expect . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Laughter ) The things are changing but the typical is that they engage in any way in knowing your situation , to make <unk> to your family and friends or to teach you some ways to modify your lifestyle to hold the risks of what you &apos;re going on .
But with all , you &apos;ll be able to wait in the hands of a very professional stranger .
As I was in the hospital , I asked me to print the buzzer of my <unk> .
It was very hard to do , because it &apos;s not very rare to ask a picture of your own <unk> .
I talked to him and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , oh , you don &apos;t mention me .
I &apos;m more than this .
The cure , whether it &apos;s , you have to confront all my self . &quot; &quot; So the next day I &apos;m going to be out of the hospital , the medical use .
I was decided to change my relationship with respect , and I was decided to learn more about him before doing something like a surgery .
I &apos;m a artist , using several types of open software technologies and open information in my work .
So my great suggestion was to protect everything , and it &apos;s going to protect the information , and it makes a way that anyone could do it .
So I created a website called &quot; &quot; La Scala , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I actually had to give them to them , but we can talk about another talk .
( Laughter ) I heard this word , &quot; &quot; La Scala , &quot; &quot; because Italian means &quot; &quot; cure , &quot; &quot; and because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; can have many meanings .
In our Western culture means to eradicate or make access to disease , but in other different cultures like for example of Asia , the Mediterranean , of the Latin countries or Africa , can represent many other things .
Of course I was interested on the opinion of doctors and the rest of health professionals , but I also believed the cure for the artist , by the poet , by the way , or , why not , for the orchestra .
I &apos;m interested with social healing , interacting with palliative healing , interacting with the spiritual cure , interacting with emotional pain , interacting with all sorts of healing .
And it worked .
The place &quot; &quot; La Scala &quot; &quot; brought around the world .
I &apos;ve heard a lot of chemical attention from Italy and the <unk> and over 50,000 people surrounded with me in very little time through emails , social network — most were advice of how to cure my brown , but many more were about how to cure myself as a person .
For example , they have found thousands of videos , images , photos and bonds to La Scala .
We have the example of <unk> <unk> and his act .
Or what did the artist <unk> <unk> : And he developed a <unk> in my tumor and put him to the ring in <unk> .
Now you can have my nickname !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s great , we can share the same thing .
And this was what was happening : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , diverse researchers — all were connected with me to catch me .
It has all this information and support , I &apos;ve been able to join a team of neurosurgeons , traditional doctors , technologists and several hundreds of volunteers with what I could talk about about information that was going to receive , which is very important .
<unk> , we &apos;ve managed to formulate a strategy of my own healing in different languages and become different cultures .
So the current strategy will extend the entire world and thousands of years of human history , things that I find pretty amazing .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
So I could take my time to meet .
I heard the doctor who wanted to work , I hated the hospital where I wanted to be , and everything as thousands of people brought me without feeling guilty for me .
All the world felt that I could be able to help me recover , and this was the most important part of La Scala .
What were the results ?
I &apos;m okay , as you can see , very well .
( Applause ) I &apos;ve heard great news after surgery : I have — wow , it had — a very low <unk> , which is a good kind of <unk> that doesn &apos;t grow very much .
I changed my life and my lifestyle .
It was very strong , that it was very strong , had a neural network connected to my brain on this side , to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
And just before the operation , we could look at this map with a physician to understand the risks that I was going to run and if there was some that I &apos;d like to avoid .
Obviously , there were .
This <unk> was the true key of La Scala .
Thousands of people shared their stories , their experience .
The doctors were talking to people who normally didn &apos;t be prepared when they treated it .
I became myself , I &apos;m in a continuous state of translation between many different languages , where science is found with emotion and the conventional research with traditional .
&#91; Neurogenesis LOVE &#93; The key point of La Scala was feeling part of a truly engaged society and connected , whose global well-being depends on each of their individuals .
This global act is my analog code for abortion .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I can &apos;t tell you what it &apos;s like to enjoy .
I didn &apos;t realize that there was something about music before .
So I &apos;m going to start with what I &apos;ve been listening to .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Well before nothing , we gave the Welcome to James Williams in the battery , ( Applause ) <unk> <unk> on the bottom , ( Applause ) ( Applause )
<unk> , as we call it , is an incredible space .
It &apos;s a sacred place .
And one of the things that makes sacred is that we don &apos;t give us the opportunity to think about the future , or in the past .
You &apos;re really alive at this moment .
You have to take a lot of choices when it &apos;s going to <unk> .
We didn &apos;t have no idea what we were going to play .
So we did an interpretation of a song called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
They all listen . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for the existing ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about somebody else &apos;s error .
The way I make a mistake when I &apos;m in the envelope — before nothing , we don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake is that you &apos;re not who to perceive that it &apos;s what else did .
Every &quot; &quot; error &quot; &quot; is a opportunity in jazz .
Although it &apos;s hard to describe what would be a funny note .
For example , if you put a color , as if I &apos;ve been playing with your suitcase , you would be like this ...
( Music ) If you &apos;re <unk> to play a pig — like Odysseus . ( Music )
You see , everything fits on the pink of colors .
If you play the E .
You see , everything is in the inside of this common emotional shirt that we &apos;re painting .
However , if you play Odysseus # # ) most of you would consider a mistake .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this cup .
At a moment , Christian is going to add this envelope .
And we &apos;re not going to react to it .
It &apos;s going to play for a second , and then I &apos;m going to stop and speak a moment .
Let &apos;s see that it &apos;s what happens when we play this suitcase .
( Music ) It turns out , someone could record it as a mistake .
I just would say that it &apos;s a mistake if we don &apos;t respond to it .
A lost opportunity .
So it &apos;s <unk> . Let &apos;s paint this cup again again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to react , but something will exchange .
Let &apos;s accept their ideas , or not .
( Music ) ( Music ) You see , he grabs his seat .
And I created a melody .
This time has changed in the battery .
It was a little more popular , a little bit more complicated in function to my answer .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is whether you &apos;re not conscious , if every musician is not conscious and don &apos;t recognize their partners to encrypt the idea , and we &apos;re not going to allow creativity .
This <unk> is really amazing .
It &apos;s an <unk> experience .
And I know I &apos;m talking for everyone when I say we don &apos;t give the damage of it .
We know that it &apos;s able to go to the equator and make music is a blessing .
What do you have to see this with the reconstruction ?
We &apos;re all musicians of jazz , our <unk> is not the most accurate for the end .
( Laughter ) I just wanted to show you how we face it .
And the other dynamic is that we don &apos;t do Kibera in the rollercoaster .
There are people who do it .
But that limit the artistic possibilities .
If it tells you the window that we look like , and I want you to be like this , and I &apos;m going to say to you .
It &apos;s going to be , let &apos;s take something .
One , two , two , three , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s a little bit <unk> because I fake the ideas .
I mean , &quot; &quot; Geoff me on this side . &quot; &quot; If I want the music to go there , the best I can do is listen .
It &apos;s the English science .
It has more than seeing what I can feel like what I can do .
If I want music to reach a certain level of modernity , the first step to me is being sick , listening to what happens to me .
When you do it , motivated and inspired to other players and they give them more , and so it &apos;s going to do it .
Look . One , two , one , two , three , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s something completely different when I took my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has a lot more mathematics .
It &apos;s not going to spread my vision .
It &apos;s going to be at the moment , to give each other and leave it to creativity .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Now , the <unk> , the <unk> , don &apos;t get the Internet on the Internet .

And I &apos;m going to show you a lot about the <unk> crisis .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; because I just had 18 minutes , but I was going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )

And I think if people don &apos;t believe it would have to get more than a lot of people .
And what we have to solve with the same way that we have to do is that we have to be solved with the same direction .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that , as if you say in the last few days , I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m going to do in the last few days .
And if you have some of them , or if you have some one of them .
He said , &quot; &quot; In this world there are two kinds of people .
If you say , &quot; &quot; Let me do that , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re thinking you &apos;re talking about what you &apos;re talking about .
( Applause ) One of the biggest challenges that we have to do is that we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
It &apos;s the cost of the common meaning of the common meaning of the world .
( Laughter )
We have to admit ourselves , and so we can save our country , I love that word , I love that word .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you about what we &apos;ve been doing in the world , which we &apos;ve been doing in fact that we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to do that .
Can you raise your hand if you take your hand back to the clock ?
It has multiple functions .
But there are things of education that have <unk> in the world .
All who talked about TED , <unk> , <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve always been a fireman . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve always been a fireman . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m always going to be bored . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve always been a fireman . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve always been bored . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot;
There was a teacher who didn &apos;t have a serious salary .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I was <unk> my talents , and I was <unk> my talents .
He said , &quot; &quot; I think now you have better opinion of me . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) And not a unique interpretation of capacity .
It &apos;s the core of what we understand by ability to understand how we can do it .
( Laughter ) Now , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now

( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to show you a little bit more or less when Eric <unk> gave his first poster .
And if you &apos;re doing what you want to like , what you &apos;re going to do is that you &apos;re going to do it .
You know , when you &apos;re doing something that you love to love .
We have to recognize that human growth has been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize that the human growth has been done .
And I &apos;m going to show you a little bit about a <unk> support based on a personalized curriculum in a personalized curriculum .
There are people who represent in the media and on the Internet .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you about the first time , and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know
He wrote this to his love .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> , then these amazing talks and ideas that are being <unk> , nanocellulose in the middle of the floor here to talk to you to play TV .
Everybody sees television .
You know . You &apos;re going to give you some aspects .
Here in America people .
The average as a American sees television is about five hours a day .
Okay ?
I live in TV , so for me , it &apos;s kind of cool .
But many people don &apos;t like .
They are actually <unk> .
They say it &apos;s useless , and things worse , let me .
My mother , when she was a kid , called him &quot; &quot; The Ghost box . &quot; &quot; My intent today is not liable if there &apos;s the good television or television , my idea today is to tell you that television has consciousness .
If I think the television has consciousness is because I think that television reflects moral needs , social policy and emotional emotional , in our action — television is how we <unk> all of our value system .
All of that is vital to humans and phenomena to our idea of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good television or it &apos;s going to be .
We talk about popular television .
We talk about 10 programs with the largest audience rate for a period of 50 years .
So as that graph is not just what you heard , which is the idea of our social and collective , if not also , how are those 10 programs for years to reflect the idea of our social consciousness ?
How do we evolve television over time , and what does this make our society be ?
So I &apos;m looking at the topic of evolution , from a basic biology , if you see that the animal realm , including humans , has four basic goals .
<unk> , relationships , power , and the desire to put it .
As humans , what you have to remember is that we developed ourselves , we evolved with time to <unk> or <unk> those basic animals .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We tend to fear , compassion .
This is not that in the animal realm .
The other thing to foster human beings is that we embrace entertainment .
You &apos;re going to see TV .
This is something that &apos;s clearly in the animal world .
These animals can like to play , but they don &apos;t get distracted .
So I want to figure out what you understand from this relative relationship from humans between television programs and human consciousness .
Why does reputation evolved so ?
I often drank it like the birds of the finger and the angels sitting in our shoulder .
television works like our consciousness , and we have to <unk> us at the same time ?
To start to answer these questions , we did a research study .
We spend 50 years from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We did at the top 20 of the audience rate that was over 50 years — thousands of programs .
We talk to 3,000 people almost 3,000 — from 18 and 70 years , and we ask them how they felt emotionally .
How did you feel you see each of these programs ?
Do you feel a moral agenda ?
Do you feel angry ? Did you ?
What did it mean for you ?
For our TED audience , I mean that this led to the United States .
But as you can see , these states of emotional needs are <unk> .
And second of the facts , 80 percent of the most popular programs of America will come to the rest of the world .
I want our audience to be recognized .
I want to give the two people before I go back to the first slide : I &apos;ve been inspired to think about the idea of consciousness and the claims that consciousness can take us on the day day , given the thank the <unk> <unk> , Jack Mhlongo .
And the way I &apos;m going to do the data , I want to give you thank you to the National Hans Institute , which you see .
Well , let &apos;s go back .
Here you see , from 1960 of 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things that we &apos;re going to start the state of inspiration and the state of moral ingenuity , which , for this study , define inspiration as the television program that get me the mood , which makes me feel better with the world .
The moral imperative are the programs that I don &apos;t understand the difference between good and bad .
At the beginning , you see that in 1960 the inspiration is keeping up .
So we see TV .
The moral imperative begins to rise .
I wake up the late of 60 , moral ingenuity increases , and the low inspiration .
Why ?
The <unk> crisis of Syria , the murder and Jr , the movement by civil rights , religious struggles , the war of the nation , the murder of King King King <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the <unk> Army .
Look at what happens .
1970 , the audacity to hate .
The moral imperative .
<unk> , more Ronald Reagan , a phone president , is on control .
Try to raise your own .
But look at it , you can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But look , you can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Yes , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But look , you can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Yes , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But look , you can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Yes , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But look , you can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Yes , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But look , you can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Yes , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; But look , you can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Yes , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; But look , you can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Yes , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; But look , you can
The moral imperative becomes in the dominant trend of 1990 to the next 20 years .
Let &apos;s take a look at this .
This graph shows a similar trend .
But in this case , we have happiness — bubble represent the social comment and <unk> in blue and green .
In the TV time we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; we have the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the national programs that reflect happiness .
It &apos;s going to increase . The happiness slows everything .
<unk> starts to go up .
It &apos;s the social comment rising .
We come back to 1965 and look at what happens .
The happiness , the expectation and social comment , not only struggle in our society , but there are two programs , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which in 1969 are number two and number three in the rates .
What was the number one ?
The number of highly <unk> <unk> , they chose and Martin &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Everybody gathered together .
The films respond in a spectacular way .
Let &apos;s look at this green peak in 1965 with a metric metric .
When you hear the term , success without <unk> , whatever mean ?
I mean that in the <unk> of 1969 , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; came out of nowhere .
This was the first program that allowed the ensemble to say , &quot; &quot; Oh god , I can discuss what I think about the World War , about the president , through TV , through TV ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I mean an successful success .
Well , the same thing in the last graph look at what happens .
1970 , the bubble was gone . It was .
We don &apos;t see television television .
The social comment and <unk> went over from 70 .
Now look at this .
What did it have achieved 70 ? Don &apos;t resign .
We have &quot; &quot; complete family , &quot; &quot; and the main program on the $ 10 for the entire decade — &quot; <unk> . &quot;
In the 50 years of television that we study , seven of the 10 more <unk> programs come back during the War of Africa , five of the <unk> for the <unk> rate .
Only a generation , in 20 years , and we discovered , okay ! TV can do that ?
Can I make me feel that ?
Can we change us ?
The audience so I knew , I want to tell you that the digital people didn &apos;t invent problems .
<unk> <unk> was <unk> out of his album together with the rest of us are 21 years old .
This is another graph . With other advantages : fantasy and imagination , which are <unk> as , &quot; &quot; I love me from the daily reality , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; What you do on the red dot , the date , which is a 325-page <unk> .
You &apos;ll see that every time the fantasy and imagination come up , it &apos;s a vest of the oyster .
Do we want to see these programs about people saving money and on the next ?
No . At the top seven , we have the slogan &quot; &quot; The <unk> woman , &quot; &quot; which was <unk> on the <unk> 10 in 1972 , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of the six million dollars and &quot; &quot; The angels of Chad . &quot; &quot; Another peak in the 1980s — another peak of programs on control and power .
What were these programs ?
<unk> and rich .
&quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
A <unk> shows our national state with rapid and tough facts : the peers .
Now this , my favorite graph , because these are the last 20 years .
You can sit or not in my banjo , sure you &apos;ve heard or read about the falling of comedy and the Internet &apos;s phone phone .
As you say this <unk> , the X marks the place .
<unk> , the decade of humor , figures like &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; All right , little little .
But look , the X marks the place .
In 2002 , in December of 2002 , the humor has played the judgment .
Why don &apos;t it ?
We had the Ministry of 2000 subjects by playing <unk> .
The miracle of the technological bubble .
The <unk> devil .
<unk> is in part of social plasticity .
So what happens with time .
In the change of century , the Internet player , the <unk> <unk> .
What do people want to do in your television ?
I think that <unk> or <unk> .
It &apos;s lost happiness , my world is going down .
No , they want to judge .
I can take out of the island .
I can do that the daughter of Sarah Palin dancing .
I can find the new player . They &apos;re taken .
Great , right ?
It &apos;s highly different that are these programs , of entertainment , I &apos;ve been there for 50 years — that &apos;s what I said at the beginning ? <unk> a basic instinct .
We &apos;re animals , we need our mother .
There was no television decade without a <unk> and French mother .
In the 1950s : June <unk> in the y-axis of the program , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he gave us <unk> to be laughing through social consciousness in the jungle .
<unk> <unk> , the archetype of the 70 70 , who talked about abortion , <unk> , even of the television in television .
In the 1980s , the first &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; below the form of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> faced with an <unk> when he came to the idea of being a deadly mother .
The mother of this was , <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a finger or a bird sitting in our consciousness , sit in our phones , what I know is that I love this picture .
So all of you , women and men of TED , the audience of TED , thanks to let me present my idea to make the consciousness of television .
But it &apos;s also going to give me a lot of the creators that wake up in the morning to store their ideas in our screens over these years .
They chop their life on television , safe , but you like <unk> , through collective social consciousness , gives you life , longevity , power or not .
So thank you very much .

In 1991 , I was in a prison in Cairo , and I met a 13-year-old boy who had been tortured and what they gave them access to a lawyer .
And to look at the eyes , I realized that the hundreds of letters that had written by political norms , never writing any letter for him , because it wasn &apos;t a 13-year-old boy who did something important for someone .
It wasn &apos;t a political policy .
It was a 10-year-old boy who would steal a bicycle .
What I also realized that was that it was not only in November , but that the 11 countries in developing development that <unk> , 92 of these countries have gotten laws that encrypt the right to a lawyer and the right to be <unk> .
And I realized that there was a incredible window of opportunities for all of us as a world community to be able to stand and bring it to the grace as research method .
We tend to think about wrongness as a form of politics , or that it &apos;s reserved as only for the worst , but in fact , 95 percent of the pleasures of today are not for political norms .
They &apos;re for people who have found in <unk> systems , and sadly , it &apos;s going to be the most cheap way of research — it &apos;s cheaper than having a court system , cheaper than having a lawyer or access to care ; it &apos;s what happens most of the times .
The day of today who is possible for us as a world community , if we take that decision , take us and end with the grace as research method for our life , but this will take three things .
First comes the shape , the power of power and the connection of the global scale .
The second is to ensure that there &apos;s a early and altruistic access to the emergency .
And the third is commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I started asking myself , and if we did it ?
Could we do something for those 275 countries ?
And I started to <unk> <unk> Palin who has such a specific mission to finish with the torment as research method and put in practice for the <unk> rights in these poorest countries , including the lawyers predicted in an initial stage in motorcycles and in <unk> .
However , my first experiences came from Cairo and the Leonardo records of my first visit to Cairo , when there was , in 1991 , even less than 10 lawyer in the country because the <unk> <unk> <unk> all .
And even 20 years later , so there was only 10 lawyers in the country , and so , in a prison , you don &apos;t just meet you with a 13-year-old boy , but you find them with women also and ask them , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , we took here about 10 years because my husband would take a doughnut but can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a place where the right state existed .
The first group of <unk> together and still reminded me , while I became , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do for research ? &quot; &quot; .
And the room would be silent , and finally , a woman stood up , &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I have been standing over more of people and I &apos;ve ever had to do any research , because they all come with <unk> . &quot; &quot; And we talk , as a lot , of the fact that first , the media may be reliable , and secondly , we wouldn &apos;t want to encourage the police to be doing this , especially because it was going on against law .
And these <unk> had to be able to be able to decide that they would start to defend and support between them to be able to put in practice these laws .
And I still remember the first few cases where they came , the 25 together , she &apos;s foot and the rest behind , and they raised him , while the judges were still saying , &quot; &quot; No , not , we &apos;re not going to do things in the same way that they &apos;ve been done until now . &quot; &quot; But one day came the perfect case . It was a woman who would see Venus and who was sitting out of a house .
She claimed that he really saw the person going to run and believed that he &apos;d steal the drums in the question , but the police came , and he got out , but she didn &apos;t have anything on it .
For that then she was <unk> . She had <unk> <unk> . I had an abortion .
And when he took his case to a judge , for the first time this herd came and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence due to the bottom <unk> and so it will be <unk> in freedom . &quot; &quot; And the ceremonies started to take cases once and again and as you see , little little , they started to change the course of Cairo &apos;s story .
But Cassini is not alone .
I used to think : then it &apos;s just in November ?
Or does it happen in other countries ?
But it happens in so many countries ...
In Buddhism , I was in a prison , and there was no 13-year-old boy , but a nine-year-old boy who would steal a phone phone .
Or a woman , I took his baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so literal ! &quot; &quot; But it wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl was three years old .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here for her , &quot; &quot; because he was convicted of stealing two sandwich and a shovel out to his baby and even this was in prison .
And when I went back to the University of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to leave it in freedom .
A judge would stop . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can tell it , but look at my prison . 80 percent of the two thousands of people here are without lawyers . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; And then the lawyers started to come back to organize a system where they could take the cases .
And we realized that it wasn &apos;t only the form of lawyers , but the connection of lawyers to represent the difference .
For example , in Cairo , what happened was that &#91; &quot; &quot; name &quot; &quot; wasn &apos;t just a simple but that she had the 24 lawyer with her who <unk> , and in the same way , in China , I always told me that &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a hot wind in the harbor when you can collect us . &quot; &quot; Or in <unk> , where I remember <unk> , after coming from a prison where all the world came up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot;
And so I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say that we can &apos;t help to create fairness that we don &apos;t get out of resources . &quot; &quot; And then he explained , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources has never been divine to injustice . &quot; &quot; And with this organized up to 6,000 lawyers who have been taking the cases in the intangible way .
So , the solution we found was the shape and then , the early access .
I &apos;ve been in Edinburgh and I decided to gather with another group of lawyers , and what they told me was that they said , &quot; &quot; Look , now we don &apos;t have police in the street , and the police is one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They changed all over the world every time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But here we have been estimated from tens of millions of recent dollars in the developing system .
What &apos;s happening next ? &quot; &quot; I was looking at one of the developing agencies , and they were forming <unk> and <unk> , which results to be normal trend , instead of <unk> .
They showed me also a manual test that was done .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to copy it . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s all in it . The lawyers can come to the police service . It was perfect .
<unk> were perfectly made .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I just have a question . Before you all get to the office office , what happened with them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a priest , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And after a priest , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And after a priest , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And after a priest , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And after a priest , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And after a priest , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And after a priest , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And after a priest , he
And so the key pieces are not just the form of lawyers , but they find a way to get in practice effectively the access to the patient , because they &apos;re the burden in the system for people who are being touched .
And while I tell you this , you &apos;re also aware that it sounds like a &quot; &quot; Yes , of course , it seems like if you could do , but can we do it in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because it seems a huge thing .
And it &apos;s a lot of the reasons why I think it &apos;s possible .
The first of them is that people about the <unk> have found ways to create miracles because of their commitment .
And it &apos;s not just <unk> , who I &apos;ve talked about in <unk> , but also <unk> around the world that are looking at some key pieces .
We have a program called <unk> , and we realized that there were people who were upset and who wanted to help them , but how could we support them ?
So it &apos;s just a plank in line where you can win five trillion dollars if you &apos;re going to happen some innovative idea to put in practice .
And there are 30 <unk> around the world , from Sri Lankan to Sydney or the <unk> <unk> , who with five dollars doing amazing things , by programming by <unk> , programs and whatever way they find .
And there are not only these <unk> , but there are also good people who understand what their contacts are and how they can move with them .
For example , in China , there were laws that would require the cops to <unk> people before they would be punished .
And while I was sitting together with one of our great lawyers , I said , &quot; &quot; And how can we spread it ? How can we be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it ?
This is amazing . &quot; &quot; And he told me , &quot; &quot; You have money ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we still find the way . &quot; &quot; And the four of December has launched three members of the Union &apos;s Union , from 14 of the best schools in the right schools , which were organized themselves and created posters with new laws , and they were starting to protect the rights of citizens .
I talked about the fact that we need to form and support <unk> .
We need to get in practice in order to start access to the emergency .
But the third and final point , most importantly , is that we engage with this .
And often people say , &quot; &quot; Well this is very well , but it &apos;s too optimistic .
It &apos;s probably going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think this opinion is interesting is because that was exactly the same opinion that it worked for people who decided to finish slavery or apartheid .
It started with a small group of people who decided to engage .
One of our favorite poems of <unk> , which they share with themselves , is , &quot; &quot; extraordinary value , friends , the way they used to be long , the route never is clear , and there &apos;s a lot on game , but on the bottom , you &apos;re not missing . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m safe that you can be able to be able to support it , we can end up with the <unk> as research method .
And I always finish , because I know that the question will be — and it will be a pleasure to talk to you at a moment , &quot; &quot; But what can I do really ? &quot; &quot; Well , first place I would say you know what you can do . And secondly , let me leave you with the story of the god , which has done it was my inspiration to initiate the DARPA Herald-Leader .
Venus was a nine-year-old kid when I met it . He was in a <unk> prison in the province of <unk> , but as I was born in prison , everybody had a lot of gratitude , even the guards , so it was the only one I could go and go out of the doors .
And of course , as you know , there are handkerchiefs . And for when you get it to grow , which is what grows ?
What it was made was to take the first axis , and then the third and then the third , and then , very hard , moving the head to power around and forth , from the third to the first . And I took my finger , because what he wanted to do was to go visit .
Of course , I could never visit around the world every day , but they wanted to visit all of the <unk> <unk> . And to take it , he happened his fingers through .
Or if the dinner were dark , it was like <unk> <unk> and seal his fingers through .
And most of the inmates knew that his greatest dream and his sun is always <unk> . And I thought , here &apos;s <unk> . A child of four years .
Born in a prison without almost nothing , no material , but with a sense of his own beautiful journey , that in my opinion we &apos;re all born in one . And she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not able to do it all .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;m going to give you the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;m pleased to have the computational imagination to imagine the shape of a new world with all of us together and I invite you to do this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; Give a talk in a red statement . &quot;
&quot; Take a story of childhood . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to be a personal secret . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a personal secret . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
&quot; <unk> with an <unk> called the action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not how you think about a TED .
In fact , if you use a lot of these devices , you seem to look a chromosome or a emotional manipulation .
But there &apos;s one thing that all great TED Talks have in common , and I &apos;d like to share with you , because listening to several hundred great TEDx Talks , like these .
I brought us with their <unk> talks , and I learned exactly them the secrets of a great talk .
And even though these talks and their subjects seem entirely different , they all have common ingredients .
And this is this : The main task as storytelling is transfer the mind of who you hear a remarkable gift , a stranger and beautiful object that we call idea .
Let me tell you .
Here &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s the point of giving a TED Talk and honestly , it &apos;s stuck .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> <unk> !
( Applause ) One 200 people , many of the things you &apos;ve never seen before you feel that their brains synchronize with the brain &apos;s brain and between each other .
They &apos;re literally beginning to visualize the same brain patterns .
And not only I mean they &apos;re feeling the same emotions .
Let &apos;s take a look at Tommy &apos;s brain a moment .
There are millions of neurons connected in a nasal .
But look here , right here : a few million are connected between each way that represents a simple idea .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to show you a little bit about the mind of all the audience .
That &apos;s this — just in a couple of minutes , a pattern that involves millions of neurons to a 200 minds , just with people listening to a voice and look at a face .
But what is a idea ?
Well , you can imagine it as a information pattern that helps us understand and navigate the world .
The ideas come from many forms and sizes , from complex and analytical , the simple and computations .
Here &apos;s a couple of <unk> examples from the TED stage .
Sir <unk> <unk> — creativity is the key of the future of our children .
( Video ) Sir <unk> : What &apos;s cool is that creativity now and we have to treat it with the same status .
Chris Anderson : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is beautiful .
( Video ) ( Video ) Brandi Rielly : I &apos;ve been around around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> the <unk> .
CA : <unk> <unk> — people are more than a simple identity .
Video : <unk> <unk> : The simple story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not supposed to be talks , it &apos;s <unk> .
CA : Your mind interprets ideas , and it doesn &apos;t just do it .
They &apos;re intimately connected .
Interestingly , it creates a incredible complex structure that is your vision of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like travelers in the world .
And about millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a little component of your view of the world is the idea that the sixth-graders are <unk> , then , by the green of this , you respond to this .
But if another component of your view of the world is the idea that snakes are dangerous , then , by the green of this , you respond to a little different .
So it &apos;s pretty obvious that the ideas that make the vision of the world are crucial .
You need to be the most reliable thing that &apos;s possible , a guide for the <unk> but wonderful real world out there .
Now , the different view of the world &apos;s world can be very different .
For example , as responds to your view of the world when you see this image : ( Video ) <unk> <unk> : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman of God , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a <unk> , &quot; &quot; even until a horse ?
Or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; with a terrorist brain ?
CA : Whatever the answer is , there are millions of people there that respond very different .
If they communicate in the right way , they &apos;re able to change , forever , the way someone sees the world and transform their actions so now as in the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that makes human culture .
So if you accept that your primary task as storytellers is building a idea in your audience &apos;s minds , here are four deliveries to address that task : First , limit your talk to a single idea .
The ideas are complex things ; you need to reduce content to be able to focus on the simple idea that more passionate minds , and having the opportunity to explain well .
You have to give context , to share examples , making it real .
So take a idea and face that it &apos;s a thread that runs all your talk , so everything that tells you in some way .
Second , giving you a reason for you to be interested .
Before we start building things in your audience &apos;s minds , you have to have their permission to go .
And what is the tool to do ?
Curiosity .
It reflects curiosity from your audience .
Using questions , influence to identify why something doesn &apos;t have sense and needs it .
If you can reveal an injury in the view of someone &apos;s world , you feel the need to fill that knowledge of knowledge .
And when this wish is much easier to start building the idea .
Third , <unk> your idea , piece of the piece of concepts that your audience knows .
It uses the power of language to get together concepts that are already in the mind of who you listen but not in your language , in their language .
It starts where they are .
The stories often forget that many of us have and concepts that are completely crazy for their audience .
Well , the metaphor play a crucial role to show how they fit the pieces , because they reveal the shape of the pattern , based on a idea that you listen to .
For example , when Jennifer Khan wanted to explain the incredible biotech technology called CRISPR CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for first time , you had a text calculator to accommodate DNA .
The CRISPR RNA allows you to cut and take genetic information very easily . &quot; &quot; Well , a explanation graph as this raises a great moment of <unk> while it fits in our mind .
It &apos;s important , so I test the talk with trust friends , and see that parts are more confused .
<unk> . Here &apos;s the final advice : I think your ideas tell me to be shared .
In this , I mean you do this question , &quot; Who does this idea do ? &quot;
And you need to be honest with the answer .
If the idea determines you and your organization , then I can say , probably not unless it &apos;s shared .
The audience sees through you .
But if you believe that the idea has the potential to light the day someone or to change someone &apos;s perspective to better or to inspire somebody to do things otherwise , then you have the essential ingredients for a good talk , one that can be a gift for them and all of us .
We just give a 25 percent of what we heard .
I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to show you every day that I &apos;m going to tell you every day .
( <unk> ) With this <unk> <unk> that &apos;s hard to listen ; listen to you .
And the art art of the conversation is that it &apos;s a little bit more important .
A world where we don &apos;t listen to each other .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going
It &apos;s trying to excite the ordinary sound .
For example , this is my <unk> .
We see that ordinary sounds can be very interesting if we get attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s the <unk> life .
Imagine you &apos;re in a street of any place of America and you &apos;re going to get a shower and you tell you , &quot; Sorry , what is the name of that apple ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; Dear — well , this is the Los Street street , it &apos;s that Wall Street .
This is the 6 street , that at 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Okay . What &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , apples don &apos;t have names .
The streets have names , the apples only are empty space with the streets . &quot; &quot; The march , a little bit <unk> and <unk> .
Now imagine you &apos;re in a street in any place of Japan , look at the person who you have on the side and ask , &quot; Oh , how do this street call this street ? &quot;
And they reply , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the Fowler apple and that 16 . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t have names .
apples are .
Look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s the 14 apple , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 .
All these apples have names . The streets only are the space without the name between apples .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know about your home ? &quot; &quot; He responded , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is the eight eight .
March 17 , a number of one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Okay . But walking by the banjo , I saw that the kids of the houses are not going into reverse . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course . They &apos;re in the instruction where they were built .
The first house built in a apple is the house number one .
The second house that we built is the house number two .
The third is the house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; I love how sometimes we have to go to the other side of the world to tell us things that we &apos;ve prevented <unk> , and we tell us that the opposite to them can also be true .
As , for example , there are doctors in China that believe that their job is safe .
So every month you &apos;re healthy , you have to pay them , and when patients don &apos;t pay paid because they think they needed their work . They &apos;re rich when they &apos;re healthy , not sick .
( Applause ) We think the song is the strong time , the beginning of musical phrase . One , two , three , four .
But in the music of west Africa , the <unk> is the end of the sentence , like the end of a sentence .
So I can listen not just in the sentence but in the way they say , two , three , four , one .
And this map is also real and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that for any real thing that you say about India , the opposite is also true .
So we don &apos;t forget before , so in TED as another place , that for any brilliant idea that we have or heard , the bet can also be true .
Let me embrace it to enjoy <unk> .
