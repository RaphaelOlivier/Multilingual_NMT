And this year , this year on the plan will be about a billion people who are actively using the electronic computer .
They have to do what they &apos;re going to do when they &apos;re afraid of them .
As it &apos;s a terrible idea , but I think it &apos;s not the worst consequences that you need to find .
And the first thing I thought about this after I was a blog was a blog blog , and the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , who died from the cancer .
Kanner asked his family , and friends wrote a series of people who were published after his death .
This is what he wrote in the early .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here , I die , and that &apos;s my last session .
I asked me , as only my body gets rid of my body , my family , I and friends are going to build a professional message that I wrote as the first part of my blog in the <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not surprising that the Egyptians , <unk> <unk> could be able to be better , and more effective , the right is that today , all of these creatures are created by <unk> , which is completely different from what was made by the previous generation .
Let &apos;s take a little bit of statistics .
Now , 48 hours of video is going to go on the <unk> <unk> .
This is 200 million points .
<unk> users produce 90 percent of the content per month .
If you &apos;re talking about your parents , or you get a car and a child , the best time they &apos;ve created a couple of pictures , or my video , or a day that &apos;s wearing some boxes .
But today , we &apos;re going to have a very wealthy digital <unk> that will live in the absence of violence as many times after our death .
And I think it creates a very exciting way to discover the possibilities for <unk> .
Now , one of the things that I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m a juggler , not a vegetarian , because I &apos;d like to tell you the pictures that the world and the future will be similar .
We &apos;re now seeing some services that allow us to solve what &apos;s going on with our online investors and investors after our death .
Once one of them , a few years later , I found me in <unk> in the New York Times .
( Audience ) Adam : Five .
( Laughter ) CA : Adam ?
E : Yeah .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) You can put you anywhere anywhere in any hour , even even the organ .
Woman : Who is this ?
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to go back to <unk> , until I was too late .
( Laughter ) Woman : Yellow , isn &apos;t it true ?
This service is doing a very simple thing : let &apos;s make a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after your death .
The second service is called 1,000 minutes .
It allows online online to train the <unk> and make these pictures , video and narratives that they can publish after your death .
But it &apos;s just surprising .
Many of you probably heard about Danny Row , which is a series of examples , how he can make more than nine hours of a car video .
I think that the best power of the machine is understanding human language , and we &apos;re starting to make a huge amount of data , which will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the content on all the lives — they &apos;re going to be clear , <unk> , video , writing , blog , that we &apos;re producing big foods .
And I think , as soon as this is going to happen , for our digital beings , we will be able to continue to continue with the real world after our death , because we have the distribution of the content that we &apos;ve created , and the ability of technology to make that sense .
Now we &apos;re going to look at a couple of experiments .
There &apos;s this service — the last step of Toronto , he analyzes all of your records in the <unk> , whatever you &apos;re doing , and make predictions that you could write the next thing .
So , as you can see , the outcome can be smooth .
Imagine what you &apos;re going to look at in five , 10 or 20 years with a higher technical opportunity .
You know , for the next step , the medical labs work on robots that can interact as people .
And if robots were able to interact on the top of the traditional <unk> of the individual person , in hundreds of thousands of different content that the person created in the whole life .
At the end , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in the end of the United States , in 2008 , when the New Jersey studio was replaced by the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And what if we could use this technology to celebrate our partners in clay , with a very efficient basis , based on the competition that they created , how did they get ?
And I think it &apos;s completely possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make data and the technology of the ability for their analysis to increase the dynamic progress .
Now , I think we all need to think , or want us to be honest ? And if that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to mean for the family of life and what the next thing is .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You &apos;re lucky to hear the obvious assumptions that we &apos;re going to do .
The first thing is , from the <unk> <unk> .
The other thing is , from the course of the government .
We really understand more about the combination of the reality .
Unfortunately , the answer to these questions is that .
This is an amazing solution .
So , you know , a piece of reality that you want to understand is that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to understand what we &apos;re going to understand .
And then you can do it , and they test them .
We have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to live with the fundamental species of the universe .
This system takes the bottom of the sand , the <unk> , the column of the spider .
And interestingly , this system is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a sense of computation .
What do we know about environmental systems ?
As a result , there &apos;s a lot of things that we &apos;ve found in the environment .
And trying to understand the system is to do that .
You know , we &apos;re going to be able to see this system .
Now , it &apos;s not a system that doesn &apos;t exist with their parts .
And there &apos;s a lot of digital systems , and there &apos;s a set of new systems .
But why are it not in the <unk> ?
Where are the economic systems ?
We focused on visual media .
That &apos;s the <unk> of my grandfather , and I have a great majority of people who have a success in the world .
And then the challenge was that it was going to change .
You may feel that nobody else saw it .
&quot; &quot; How are they educated ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to find it alone ?
Or , by course , the RNA .
These are companies that are working on more than one country , and there are 4,000 .
And it took a lot of time , and it took a network where 6,000 points are going to come out of the risk .
It &apos;s about 75 percent of all the men .
And in the center , it &apos;s financial structures .
But they &apos;re going to take 95 percent of the income from the basic organization .
But where do you answer the question about who &apos;s going on ?
You can make others do how it needs to do it .
I want to get through the Arhuacos .
And also with the <unk> , he &apos;s a <unk> .
And this is the main 73 acres of mine .
For some of the <unk> rules .
Now , that &apos;s probably the universe that &apos;s probably the universe .
Now , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong in the way we talk about love .
It &apos;s really effective when we talk about this experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I think of this metaphor , you can see the stage of the <unk> — like this person , he &apos;s walking on the ground , not notice , he goes back to the <unk> , and he goes back to the <unk> .
And I think that &apos;s true , because the grandchildren are not careful .
<unk> is unexpected and not static .
It &apos;s something that happens with us without our knowledge .
I &apos;m a writer , and I &apos;m also teaching English English , which means to talk about the words , I &apos;m a tragedy of life .
You can say , and I wanted to emphasize that many of the equations that we &apos;re going to do to talk about love is perhaps a big part of them — we have a problem .
So love , we &apos;re holding .
We &apos;re going to panic .
We &apos;re expanding .
We &apos;re in exile .
We &apos;re looking at the passion .
It makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
The heart is happy , and then it &apos;s <unk> .
So our metaphors are going to be <unk> in someone who &apos;s given violence or disease .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s so .
And they &apos;re taught us as a <unk> and not worse .
My favorite with them is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And if you look at this word in the script — ( Laughter ) — you see what it means and &quot; &quot; terrible <unk> , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be strong . &quot; &quot; As a rule , I &apos;m reading the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; with a very different <unk> , with a <unk> <unk> .
At the same time , one in the bottom of the bottom , you have 46 explanations on the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is used for the master of God .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing the same word to talk about love , which is the expression of the <unk> . ( Laughter )
Is it awesome ?
So how did that happen ?
How did we go back to post-traumatic pain and suffering ?
And why do we talk about this kind of good experience , how do we be a victim ?
It &apos;s hard questions , but I have a couple of theories .
And to figure out this , I want to focus on one of the major metaphors that I love as crazy as I am .
When I first started studying the sexual love , I met these metaphors about my own self everywhere .
In the history of the West culture of language , the language of the language of the mental illness .
Here &apos;s a couple of examples .
William SS : <unk> is only a little bit of me , &quot; &quot; Love is always a little bit of me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m always going to have a lot of fun . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> is always a little bit of me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Solomon , it &apos;s always a little bit of me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Solomon , it &apos;s always a little bit of me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , it &apos;s always a little bit of me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , it &apos;s always a little bit of me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , I
&quot; &quot; Look at me , look at the hell , &quot; &quot; which is a great poet of <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
I was born in 20 years , and it was a lot of good relationships from the end of the beginning .
It was relationships for the first few years , because for me , it was very high to me , and I had a lot of revenge .
Especially I remember one moment .
I was sitting in my bed in South America , and I looked at my brother walking on the door .
It was clear , and it was almost a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to talk to dinner , and when we went back to our room , he left their things in the darkness , and they pulled out .
I don &apos;t remember the truth of this argument , and I &apos;m very clear to remember it .
I was 22 , that was my first <unk> in the country , which is going to be built and I was just one .
And I had a week with my sister home , and I knew a city where I was standing , and the name of the city that I needed to leave to find , but I didn &apos;t have my shoes , I didn &apos;t have the shoes .
I didn &apos;t have a lot of <unk> and very small money , and I didn &apos;t know the conductor .
Some of the most courageous people I could have been able to break it as a moment of opportunity , but I got stuck .
I just sat there .
And then it started .
But despite me , a little voice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . It was <unk> .
I &apos;m really excited for this . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because I wanted to feel a lot of my love in love .
Now , it &apos;s funny for me so much , but in 22 years , I had to have a <unk> of experience , and at that point , I was a <unk> , and I was quiet , and it was a little bit strange , but I thought it was a little bit of a <unk> of my feelings with a guy who just left me .
I think at the level of the level , I wanted to be a little bit like a chef , and I thought it was so happy and works .
It &apos;s really not supposed to be surprising to be surprising , because in the West , there are twins , 14 songs , two or one , and one of the names of the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , and he went back to our room .
We &apos;re angry .
That &apos;s true . &quot; &quot; I was expecting that my first love would be similar to me .
But I &apos;m going to take someone like this — like my wealth is completely <unk> , not very good for me or for him .
But I think this is not very unusual .
Most of us feel a little bit of <unk> in the early grade .
In fact , there &apos;s a study that &apos;s true that it &apos;s true , because the <unk> , the intensity and the logic , is not so easy to get away .
It &apos;s really true .
This is a study in 1999 using blood analysis to predict that the crime rate is very similar to the role of <unk> in people with diagnoses .
( Laughter ) So , and the level of the <unk> is also working with the <unk> and depression .
So there are a few of the evidence that love is linked to the changes of our mood and the spices .
And other studies are <unk> , which is that most relationships are going to come like this .
The people are going to find that the poor level of atrazine is connected to the conversation of the <unk> , which is a sense of feeling like someone who has been in your own own own body .
And most of us feel like that when the first time is blind .
Only a few months ago , a few months ago .
When I went back to my journey in South America , I spent a lot of time in my room , showing me a documentary .
And I decided that when my friends can &apos;t understand my weakness , I hate their friends .
So I stopped to meet a lot of them .
And that was probably a year in my life .
But I think I feel that I &apos;m going to be miserable — this is my job , and if I was a teenager , then I could show me how much I was sleeping .
And when I could give that , then we &apos;ve always been together together .
This is the theme of me , and there &apos;s no political rule that the fact that the big suffering is going to lead to a big respect , but we &apos;re talking about love as if it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s the experience of compassion and biological , and culture .
Our engineers tell us that love is good , and the combination of the <unk> of the value of our brain , and she says that love hurts , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know whether you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , you know , if you don &apos;t know that love , if you think about it , if you think about it , you know , love is a good thing , and it says that the love of vulnerability , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , you know , you know , love is a good thing , and it tells us that the love of vulnerability , if you don &apos;t know , if you don
In fact , you &apos;ve heard about this — I &apos;m talking about the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to take a break from the ark , which I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) And then our culture is using a language to create and address this idea of love .
And this is where we talk about the metaphors of pain , and I &apos;m going to do a lot of things .
It &apos;s a pretty interesting <unk> .
<unk> and sometimes cruel , and we &apos;re showing that through our words and history , but then our words and history are going to be able to help us to pay the strengths and the disappointments .
Interestingly , this is all happening in culture , which is a <unk> <unk> .
We want to be a <unk> , and we want it to live all the lives .
This is a funny thing .
( Laughter ) To do it , we need to change our culture , or change our expectations .
Imagine that we all had less <unk> in love .
If we were more confident , more open to the new , more <unk> , and then instead of drinking in love , we were in it .
I know that it takes a lot of things , but I &apos;m not the first person who &apos;s doing it .
In the book , &quot; &quot; <unk> , which we live in &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , and George <unk> offers the amazing decision of this needle : we need to change our metaphors .
They &apos;re going to count , and they can even act as a group of our future , as the ones that are going to get .
Jonathan and <unk> offers a new metaphor for fear : <unk> as a lot of art art .
I really love this way to think about love .
In fact , Hannah is saying that the metaphor of enzymes , which is essentially a way to detect all of the applications , or ideas that are going on in metaphors .
Jonathan and <unk> are talking about all of the things that the art of art is supposed to be : <unk> , computer , <unk> , collective purpose .
And these ideas are very good for our traditional societies in the digital age of relationships , but they &apos;re also good and in other types of relationships — short-term hours , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — because these metaphors are going to be much more sophisticated ideas in the experience of someone &apos;s experience .
So if love is a lot of art art and love , it &apos;s the master of the experience .
It &apos;s not tragic , love is creative , love requires a lot of generosity and <unk> , and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
And love is suffering with pleasure and pain .
On the bottom , every experience of life is different .
When I was a little bad , I never thought that you could not do anything that I was doing .
When the girl &apos;s grandfather first met — or when he had a girl &apos;s Day , he couldn &apos;t be a <unk> , which she met four days ago , and she didn &apos;t have a hostility or in the accent .
Where is it ?
She wants to be dead .
Right ?
And as a teenager , at this moment , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a third of five , Risen &apos;s not dying .
He &apos;s alive , he &apos;s healthy , he just went out of the city .
I realize that the <unk> of the 19th century in the modern British American , but when I first read this letter , and I was 14 years old , the pain of Thanksgiving was important for me .
Before I understand love as something that I &apos;m going to do with something that I &apos;m interested with , not what I &apos;m going to do with me without my relationship or the snake , it &apos;s going to be <unk> power .
But it &apos;s still hard .
And it &apos;s sometimes completely awkward and <unk> , and when I feel a prize , I have to remind myself : my job in these relationships — to talk to my partner about what I want to do together .
It &apos;s also a puzzle .
But it &apos;s much better than the other option that love is a great self .
This is the second thing that &apos;s not going to take a difference or a little bit of shame .
Instead of doing this , it requires a trust of the dream of the <unk> and the <unk> , when it &apos;s hard to do it , that it sounds very simple , but in fact , it &apos;s actually the exponential space .
If you have to stop thinking about yourself and your expectations , or the loss of these relationships , and start thinking about what you might offer .
And this is the second thing that allows us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good . Maybe it &apos;s not for us . &quot;
And , &quot; &quot; These relationships were great than I was planning , but yet it was great . &quot; &quot; The great art of art is a good thing that he &apos;s not going to be able to be able to be able to express himself .
And this is the second thing that allows us to decide how it will look like it .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Not in the &apos; 50s , I &apos;ve been a student with a friend in Alabama , which is in the <unk> town , in the city of the Senate , which is in Jerusalem .
You know how it comes when you &apos;re young and tired of money , we didn &apos;t go to the Disney , with a lot of the national park , the <unk> song , to say , the most long way .
Not in southern Dakota , after 3,000 miles tall , I turned to friends and I talked about what I was going to do for a <unk> .
&quot; &quot; What is this one and a character that &apos;s everywhere the road of the road ?
Her eyes on the box were thrown up .
It &apos;s a surprise that you &apos;re sitting at the first time that it &apos;s very accurate now .
( Laughter ) And so I said , &quot; &quot; You know , these signs of the road of the road , which is in China . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s going to give me a few moments , and then I &apos;ve got a lot of arguments , because eventually , I think that I think I &apos;m going to get a lot of time .
That &apos;s what I am .
( Laughter ) Here he is , these famous and a character of the place for the piano . ( Laughter )
In the last five years , I &apos;ve learned a lot about this situation , because we sometimes ignore the signs of borders , and how we feel , when we don &apos;t understand , and what we feel about the human behavior .
In fact , I &apos;ve spent the last five years in terms of infidelity .
Now , the real choice of the game , you can hear the <unk> , but there &apos;s a big choice : the <unk> of the <unk> .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us would be able to see the boundary of our injustice , whether you don &apos;t want to think about the possibility of their identity .
We understand that .
We realize that sometimes everyone in this room is wrong .
We are people , we &apos;re feeling wrong . Okay , bad .
But when I &apos;m on the right , this moment , I think that &apos;s the time that I &apos;m going to tell you this time , and suddenly all of the things that I think about human tolerance are going to come down , and I can &apos;t imagine that it &apos;s wrong .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in this period of time .
They &apos;re at the halls , and they &apos;re still on the <unk> , they still go back to the <unk> and give their voice .
What you think is that we all have all of our lives through the skin , believe that we always have to be right .
That &apos;s what I think is a problem .
And I think this is a problem like each of us , in your own personal , personal level , and we &apos;re all together as a society .
What I want to do today is the first thing that we &apos;re looking at in the senses of our right .
Secondly , that &apos;s why it &apos;s a problem .
And at the end , I want to convince you that you can be able to sit with the <unk> , and if you do that , it &apos;s the best of all of the time of dreams , the brilliance and creativity that you can do .
Why do we feel in the senses of our privacy ?
There are a lot of things that have to do with the feeling of injustice .
Let me ask you , maybe Kate , you &apos;re here , and I &apos;m going to have a lot of emotion if you &apos;re not right ?
Innovation . No .
<unk> . Good , cool , superhero .
<unk> , with unconscious feelings , the feeling of compassion , all of them are great answers , but they &apos;re going to answer the second question .
And you &apos;re going to answer the question , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the sense of knowing that you &apos;re not the truth .
( Laughter ) Now , the idea of your mind is to feel like a sentence , and it &apos;s also a lot of <unk> , not ?
For example , it may be a terrible sense , or the feeling of compassion , or even a happy sense , like my stupid Chinese character .
But the truth is that it doesn &apos;t have any sense of emotion .
And the example of this is <unk> .
Remember a company called <unk> <unk> , where they &apos;re going to get the same hour , but I don &apos;t want to tell you a little bit of shoes ?
It &apos;s almost that in every <unk> of this symbiosis , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , and it &apos;s blue , which is not funny , because the camel is a loop , and it &apos;s going to go back .
But every time you get a snake out of the rock now , you &apos;re still in August .
It &apos;s funny , especially if you &apos;re six years old , because it &apos;s a <unk> .
He just kept running , until it was not going to get to the bottom of the sky , and it &apos;s not clear that it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
This is the time he starts clapping .
If we &apos;re in something wrong , we don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on , and yes , we &apos;re looking at it , and then we &apos;re going to do it , and then we &apos;re going to go back .
You can see , we &apos;ve been wrong , we &apos;ve already seen this campaign , but we still feel confidence on the ground .
I need a lot of things to use what I &apos;m going to say .
There &apos;s a sense of feeling in your own injustice , which is the sense of their rights .
( Laughter ) And because of this structure , we used to make sense of our rights .
I &apos;m going to take this mistake .
In fact , we don &apos;t have to be in the middle of the mechanism that we &apos;ve learned when we &apos;re honest .
There &apos;s another reason why we &apos;re fighting this , and it &apos;s more than a culture .
Imagine a little bit of the initial school .
You &apos;re sitting there , and you &apos;re a teacher running through the test , and one of them looks like this .
In fact , it &apos;s not my own .
( Laughter ) Here you &apos;re in your school , and you know what you think about the <unk> that you &apos;ve done .
He &apos;s hairy and shocked , he never does the homework .
So , the next woman you &apos;ve learned is that , firstly , those who are wrong about these people who are wrong , <unk> , <unk> , and secondly , to achieve success in life , cannot be wrong .
We &apos;re looking at these great lessons very well .
Most of us , and as I think , especially in this case , the treatment of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
Or not , the CEO of the <unk> , he &apos;s still a <unk> , he &apos;s still a golfer ?
( Laughter ) How do you go , you all have these engineers , brands and boys .
Hmm will be .
It &apos;s worse only when we assume that we may be wrong .
Because think about this , when we do the magic , we &apos;re going to decide that something is wrong with us .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re going to take ourselves , because we feel smart , incentives , <unk> and <unk> .
Let me tell you about the case .
A few years ago , after the name of Dr. <unk> <unk> , he had a woman for surgery .
This is a hospital in Boston .
In this hospital , a student in Harlem , he &apos;s one of the best people in the country .
The poet was taken up and worked in the process of the body .
I was walking through a drug , a surgeon on her backpack , and then he <unk> her , and she &apos;s holding her to the <unk> ceiling .
Okay , it was true .
And the girl wakes up , and he says , &quot; &quot; Why am I going to do not on the jar ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s going to be on the jar , because the surgeon has done a <unk> act on her left corner , not in the right .
When this story was told by the <unk> of the <unk> , he said something very amazing .
&quot; &quot; The <unk> of the surgeon just felt that he was working on the right jar . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why am I going to tell you that , because we believe that you &apos;re looking at the right bacterium that you &apos;re looking at on the right bacterium , maybe it can be very dangerous .
This is a physical sense of the self that we &apos;re all aware of , and we can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to act as one of the other things that are really happening in the world .
And if we &apos;re in our own room , we &apos;re just not thinking about the possibility of our relativity , and we &apos;re doing <unk> as a result of <unk> million barrels in the Gulf of Mexico , or <unk> global economics .
It &apos;s a huge problem for practice .
But that &apos;s also the hypothetical problem for society .
Think about a minute , which means the sense of your rights .
That means that your trust is conscious from the reality of the reality .
This is a sense of a problem that explains all the people that you &apos;re wrong with .
What you &apos;ve shown is that most of us are showing ourselves people with other perspectives using the <unk> .
The first thing we tend to think about when someone &apos;s wrong is to prove that they &apos;re not sure about these questions .
They just don &apos;t have access to the information that you have , and if you &apos;re a little bit of this information with them , they &apos;re waiting , and they &apos;re going to go to your forehead .
If it &apos;s not going to happen when we say that they have the same facts of us , but we &apos;re going to continue with us not to blame , we &apos;re going to end up in the second chance — because they &apos;re idiots .
( Laughter ) So let &apos;s have all the pieces of furniture , and they &apos;re crying , and they can &apos;t do it .
And if it doesn &apos;t work when we realize that people who don &apos;t care , they have the same facts , and they &apos;re very smart , we &apos;re going to turn up to the end , and they know the truth , but for their pompous purpose of the legacy of this truth .
This is a disaster .
And what our responsibility is to experience our own minds is not giving us the mistakes , especially if it &apos;s true , and makes us wrong with each other .
What I &apos;m going to do is I think that &apos;s tragic , and I think it &apos;s tragic that it &apos;s almost about our human identity .
Well , we want to believe that our minds are the reckless <unk> of the windows that we &apos;re putting them out , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the dark light .
And we want all the trees on the world through the same glass , and we saw the exact same thing .
This is a gift , and if it was , it would be incredibly boring .
Our mind is not because we can see the light that he has .
It &apos;s because we can see light not like there .
We can have memories about the future , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what we are , other people in other places .
It &apos;s because everybody sees the sounds , we can look at the same piece of fine-tuning and see it , and that &apos;s , and that &apos;s .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re going to stop .
In 12,000 years , before Dave had had his mouth , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; the guy from the <unk> of Jerusalem wrote &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong and I &apos;m going to get a needle . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong and I &apos;m scared . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong and I &apos;m going to get a needle . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong and I &apos;m scared . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong and I &apos;m going to get a needle . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong and I &apos;m scared . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong and I &apos;m going to get a needle . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m wrong and I
<unk> realized that the fact that our inability to be wrong is not to be able to express the human system , not anything to be able to be able to eliminate or kill .
This is the foundation of our humanity .
Because we &apos;re not afraid , we don &apos;t really know that in this world .
Unlike other animals , we &apos;re very hard to try this light .
And I think this is a continuous conversation , and it &apos;s the essence of the rest of our productivity and the artwork .
And I started listening to various reasons , and I started listening to a lot of programs called this American life .
I was listening , listen , and my dad began to feel that all the traditions are about the sky .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Yes .
Now , I always , like crazy , see the injustice .
She seems everywhere . &quot; &quot; The Himalayas were .
But after a month , I had an opportunity to do the opportunity to sell the New Yorker .
I shared this argument with them , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s true .
He said that the software of software even tells us that in every college , it &apos;s the most <unk> .
She says , &quot; &quot; I thought that &apos;s what you can do , and it really happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What we need to do .
We need to do the <unk> and make the injustice to make these gaps . &quot; &quot; What we all do , you know , in the quality of the love , or reading the scientists that we have .
We &apos;re going to like to make a lot of things that we &apos;re going to do with a lot of things , and we &apos;re not going to be able to do the end of the end .
What we &apos;ve told us is that we &apos;re wrong .
But you know that our origins are so , because our lives are like this .
We think it &apos;s going to be true , and it &apos;s really true .
George Blair thought that the attack was able to be able to be able to be able to have a lot of money to fund , to kill people and give people to the United East .
And it really happened .
Also , Susan Mitchell thought that he would be a fan of Egypt for the rest of my life , as I don &apos;t touch and <unk> , and then he could send my son &apos;s son .
And it really happened .
Now , you might have thought that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to go to school with school , you &apos;re going to go to the city and the price of how many of them are together .
And it really happened .
And I have to admit that I thought that I was writing the best book about something that you don &apos;t have , for the gods who never will .
And it really happened .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s life .
We &apos;re making amazing ideas about binary light , if it &apos;s — it &apos;s the best thing , if it &apos;s not — it &apos;s not . And the light is <unk> and hit us .
Don &apos;t accept , but the whole thing exists as a hero of ours .
We &apos;ve spent a long week to talk about innovation , improvements and transport . But you know why we need these innovations , and we &apos;re going to improve and do the money ?
Because half of the ideas that were crazy , and they had the ability to change light — in TED in 1998 , what &apos;s happening there .
( Laughter ) Don &apos;t be fired , or not ? ( Laughter )
Where am my thesis to the mouth , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we &apos;re going back here .
And that &apos;s going to be going on .
We &apos;re looking at another idea .
We &apos;re telling another story .
We meet another institution .
Today , you &apos;ve heard seven million times , as you &apos;ve heard of the great thing .
I mean , if you really want to be proud of you , you &apos;re going to get away because of this <unk> , and the <unk> space of your rights and the <unk> of your rights , and you &apos;re also a little bit of <unk> , <unk> and the magic of the universe and let me say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Let me thank you . ( Applause )
And five o &apos;clock of a man named Tel El-Saad went up to Manchester , and he took the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the leader of the Department of Justice .
After the first century , we had a <unk> , but when you look at other cases , he and his supporters started planning the attacks of the New York City , including <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the state of the <unk> River .
Fortunately , these plans were sold by <unk> .
But unfortunately , explosions in 1993 , in the developing fund , didn &apos;t have to do it .
It was the result of the Violence <unk> .
El El-Saad is my father .
I was born in <unk> , <unk> , in 2003 , and the Egyptian engineer and the <unk> and the <unk> of the French class , and they were trying to make my childhood happy .
But when I got seven years old in our family , we started going to change .
My father gave me this side of the Islamic , which is small to see , including even a lot of Muslims .
Now , the real experience shows that when people recognize one one , they &apos;re not a lot of time to understand that we all want one other thing .
But in every rehearsal , every single percentage of the people who have been able to have a small percentage of people who have been so likely to be able to use their beliefs , that they need to use any kind of action to make others live in their rules .
For a few months , my father gave me me and told me that a few of the last previous subjects he was in the <unk> of Long <unk> for a teacher .
He said that the next morning , I &apos;m going to go to them .
We went to the <unk> of the <unk> , and we went back to CERN .
And this day , my last sketch in the March of the <unk> <unk> , and , with all of a sudden , I had a lot of fun , and especially I had a lot of fire .
A girl came back to her friends and said , &quot; &quot; Go on . &quot; &quot; Like the father , that &apos;s the son .
And they were all very hard to do this , but only a few years later , I realized it was completely different .
They saw me a <unk> , which was my father .
And the result of these people is that these people were <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , which was the <unk> of the Gulf of Mexico , and this glacier led to death by six people , they had more than 1,000 .
This was the men I was talking about .
These people are called &quot; &quot; sheep &quot; &quot; , which means &quot; &quot; sheep . &quot; &quot; It means &quot; &quot; sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , these people have been called &quot; &quot; sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , these people are called &quot; &quot; sheep . &quot; &quot; I mean , these people , I call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve been planting 20 times a year , and that &apos;s my childhood for me to give me a chance to get friends .
Every time I began to feel comfortable in one place , I took a time to pick things and go to another town .
It &apos;s always new faces in the classroom , and I often had a lot of fun .
I was fascinated by my personality in the mystery of the <unk> , to not get rid of it , but as I &apos;m still , for a new kid in the classroom .

But I &apos;m convinced that my social skills were , frankly , no longer . It &apos;s not the best design for the real life of life .
And I learned to think about people on the verge of <unk> , like <unk> or race .
What would I find my eyes ?
The first story that the challenge of this mindset was , it happened at the time of the year of the Year of 2000 .
And I was able to do a program that I was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a <unk> in the Army .
My group was the privilege of violence .
Our groups represent the most different plastics of society .
One day , I &apos;ve learned that one of my new friends was <unk> .
Because this is a picture of a couple of days , it &apos;s lost by the unknown , the insect .
I never had a friends of <unk> , and frankly , I was proud that I was proud of the deck of a bar , which I believed almost all my life .
And the final moments were flying under the <unk> <unk> . It was a parking park .
And there I saw people in the most different <unk> and culture , and that experience was founded by the fundamental self of my personality .
It &apos;s not a good thing .
As a legacy , I got the opportunity , and I quickly found that many of them were the most bad .
I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m going to do a lot of people who don &apos;t want to do it . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not going to be able to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to do a lot of people who don &apos;t want to do it .
And this feeling allowed me to share the stereotypes that I learned in childhood , with life experiences .
I &apos;m convinced how this is to be a <unk> .
And then , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; Every night John <unk> gave me to be a nightmare with myself in my own community , and I helped me realize that race , whether or sexual , don &apos;t have any difference as a matter of identity .
There was a lot of things that he took to me that I needed so much .
The weather is often going to come when it &apos;s not going to go , and I &apos;m very excited to understand that a little bit more <unk> in my universe is more heartbreaking than my father &apos;s father .
One day , I was talking to my mother about how I began to change my light , and she told me something that I would leave my life all my life .
She looked at me with a funny eye more than a little bit of fun and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to hate people .
And this moment , I realized how much energy is required to train this kind of hatred of itself .
<unk> is not my own name .
I rented him when my family , I decided to break relationships from my father and start a new life .
So what do I find with my own identity and my <unk> to make it safe ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I &apos;m doing this in hope that somebody who has a friend of mine , and I &apos;m clear that there &apos;s better violence . I didn &apos;t have a scholarship .
Instead of doing this , I use my experience of fighting against the <unk> , fighting against the <unk> .
I do this for the imam , and for their homes , the pain of pain and injuries that were thrown on their feet because of the <unk> .
In contrast to the state of the gymnosophist , I &apos;m talking about these disturbing changes and the judgment of my parents .
And I &apos;m looking at this as evidence that violence is not a major part of the <unk> or race , and the son doesn &apos;t want to follow the path of my parents .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you every one of you . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
And it can be a choice about how to make children .
And one of them is not the best for each other .
You can help make a big choice less than a little bit of a little bit less than a little bit less .
When I went back to Kenya , I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I had a lot of time , and I was going to have a lot of people in my life .
And I had a <unk> in the middle of the middle , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to be able to think about it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) (
It &apos;s hard , and it &apos;s hard , and it &apos;s just not there .
So , you know , it &apos;s going to be a good choice .
But it can &apos;t be possible .
If the decisions are good , but it seems to be the wrong idea .
The hour of the family , and so on .
Now , this is a real artist , and it &apos;s going to allow you to be able to do it .
We have a tendency to predict .
It &apos;s called <unk> .
And you &apos;ve created reasons for yourself .
What we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to do it .
I &apos;m somebody who loves chocolate <unk> .
If we &apos;re changing the reasons for ourselves .
You become the same person .
A few years ago , and then I decided to take a journey , a big American scientist , Al <unk> .
I &apos;ve learned about this 30 years later .
And instead of <unk> , not a few months later , the hour became much more cautious .
This is a picture of my challenge when I did a picture every day .
I &apos;ve never done the story .
I also grew up .
In fact , the main thing is not going to be closed .
But it &apos;s a little bit of their own own own .
It &apos;s frightening .
I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m an expert in the technological technology .
Not if I want to say , I can say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer .
And I realized that when I did a small , external change , they were the eyes of my favorite habits .
In fact , they &apos;re the poorest .
( Applause )
I &apos;m incredibly fortunate to be born in a country that is going to find the best place in the world to be women .
In 1985 , when I was seven years old , women in Somalia went to the runway .
This day , they didn &apos;t work , regardless of whether they had a business room , or just home .
They went to the <unk> of the <unk> , and they found 90 percent of women — and the world , and they asked them to talk about happiness .
It didn &apos;t work in Paris in this day , and nothing works when women don &apos;t .
( Applause ) Within five years , the Iranians had courage to be the first country in the world that had been elected by a woman in the role of the president .
I &apos;ll never forget that day when President <unk> , I believe in our own imam , went to the horse of my house , my mother &apos;s mother , and then my victory .
( Applause ) It became incredible criteria for me and everyone who grew up at that hour , including boys .
She often told a story about a boy who had taken her after a few weeks on the lab , and he said , &quot; &quot; And boys can also be president when they grow ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the traditional models are really important , but even with the real ones that I &apos;m very naive when I was trying to focus on the model of President , my first reaction was , &quot; &quot; Who am I going to focus on this model ?
Who am I going to be the president ? &quot; &quot; And what &apos;s interesting is that women are less likely to be funded in a model than men .
This is a study that happened in the United States in 1991 , and it &apos;s estimated that 72 percent of the men have found their own account in the model of the president , but only 45 percent of women .
We see the productivity of 86 percent , and that &apos;s the same time that it &apos;s a decade ago .
It &apos;s a real shame , because I believe that this world needs women and more objective leadership .
And so my decision to focus in the end of the valley was that I needed to make my privilege , even without keeping my own experience , to go back and try to try to build the world that would be meaningful and three to our children , who we &apos;re really allowed to afford and boys to do in the rest of what they want .
This was the journey of my life .
It was great .
It started to come from 20 <unk> to the toaster .
After a drug , the number of people went to the top of the <unk> , and then finally we went back to us , a few men and me .
( Applause ) But it &apos;s not the same thing .
Perhaps you realize that there &apos;s a lot of malaria in the United States , but I can — ( Laughter ) — I can say that we &apos;re in 1918 .
In the first 20 years , the last 20 years , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it doesn &apos;t seem to be fun , that might be the same thing to the passwords .
And then he &apos;s thinking when our mission , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; because we have a lot of famous <unk> , who were convicted of his family and his family .
In Paris , it was the embodiment of the prize , because the president of the U.K. believed that the country needs a leader .
And after a few days , the work of his wife and her family was also organized in the <unk> , and he &apos;s back again with lions .
Before the truth , he recognizes what it does , because there are two skilled men who can be able to be a year in the lab .
So nine trips , 45 days of choice , on the right looked at me not very well .
I didn &apos;t even have a place in the newspaper .
Now , I had one percent , but I had one percent , but all of them , it was a chance to meet women &apos;s girlfriend .
The truth is that I had to tell you that I had to have a flaw of all of the things to get my place in the basement and go to the <unk> , because the waiter decided to take up to the <unk> of two percent of the votes in the first <unk> .
And the day of these arguments found that I would be going to be there with my friends , and at the time , I found that I had two percent of the first debates .
( Applause ) And about problems .
The bad problems that we had to meet and do this journey were working with the media , entertainment and play .
I &apos;m going to be in the media .
Some times that the death is not the norm for the media and politics .
I can &apos;t lie .
And I &apos;ve been able to get a lot of access , so I &apos;m going to go through the media .
And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the Smithsonian in the Smithsonian in the Smithsonian for a few months before the election , at the time I &apos;ve been born with 31 times .
And I don &apos;t say the media is doing this .
I feel that the reason in the absence of political literacy , in the media , in more traditions , like religion , has a spiritual and subjective humility , and we need courage to talk about this when we want to change .
When I got access to anthropology , the first question was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to get your sandwich ? &quot; &quot; That was a big question .
And then , after one one of the two percent of the voices of voting , they can understand it .
But the media is really changing , and every time I went to the Cassini , we saw and I felt a lot of work in the polls , so I know not a little bit of how important it is , and why we need to talk about that .
I &apos;ve never had one of the <unk> <unk> in the first day .
Sometimes I was a <unk> because the questions that we had all the rest of them , and because of the choice of choice .
I met this , but I &apos;m going to tell you a computer engineer .
It wasn &apos;t almost any of the comments with my hair or the norm .
( Applause ) Hmm , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
But there &apos;s another very important experience .
I was scared as a fear for a poster , without controlling the <unk> or <unk> .
These are the lack of experiences and access to resources , perhaps the roads of our company , but they also allow us to get the new and make politics differently .
Our company was <unk> , and so we may have changed the same choice for others .
In this case , less than a half of the time in Norway , because I wanted to show you the importance of the <unk> .
And if you have access to the media at the same time , we &apos;ve mapped the information of information .
I was going to go online online in Facebook , and I was asked for any of the questions of the voice .
All of the questions that we &apos;ve been talking about with the answer , we &apos;ve been able to have access to Facebook , and we &apos;ve believed in the importance of the difference when you get to trust trust .
And if it was a problem that was a serious decision to get attention to young choices , I started using Scratch .
So I &apos;ve been looking at how to do it , and I &apos;ve been using every single <unk> at Starbucks during the last part of the company .
I really needed a lot of <unk> and frustrations , because I &apos;m angry .
But by doing that , we grew up with a number of prophets .
What &apos;s going on is that we can be able to build a company and another way .
Unfortunately , you can &apos;t talk about politics and not worry about money .
The sad thing is that all of that is true , but it &apos;s true , and we had less <unk> resources than others else .
Perhaps the reason of the part was that , in my opinion , the hour was not right enough to go back to the Christmas <unk> .
And maybe I wanted to do more with less than a little bit of the computer .
Some people tell you that this is a very quiet night .
But even with the tragic media and the nurses , and only the <unk> , but the great team , we &apos;ve been surprised for all of the day when the first numbers are .
I was surprised by myself as you can see on the picture .
( Laughter ) The first data I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to get a call with the passwords .
( Cheers ) Well , it &apos;s too good , and I didn &apos;t have to win , but I took the second place , and we got a long way from one another , and we took a long amount of voices , and we were able to have a survey of 400 percent of our voices , which was 10 percent more than the last survey .
Because this is a couple of people , I &apos;m going to give me a promise of choice , and many people would call me a little bit back again .
But in fact , I thank you to be proud of understanding that I &apos;ve spent a lot of money in the cost of the <unk> , and the vast number of people were encouraging me to sleep in 2025 .
( Applause ) Now she &apos;s 13 , and she never had to be in 12,000 .
But in the day , I couldn &apos;t see her in Cambridge , she was a wise , confident , she was honest and supported his mother .
Maybe it was the most recent moments of my company .
( Applause ) But it was another one .
As a day , girls who have been watching my daughter at the bus <unk> , and they had to kill him .
Interviewer : Oh !
This is a picture for me .
We can achieve the rest of what we see .
There &apos;s a lot of pain and problems .
( Applause ) The kids in the workplace need , and it &apos;s a time of women to pray , they will be a <unk> model or a president .
I also had to call you a book of &quot; &quot; The Economist . &quot; &quot; I had a new guy , &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Cheers ) I think that &apos;s my most proud man , and women are too often very often in using emotional capital , like I &apos;m going to be , but you know , I know , because we &apos;re just going to win if we do that .
( Applause ) And we need more to use this .
And the day we &apos;ve got a little bit of choice , as we &apos;re going to win , because we felt ourselves .
You don &apos;t want to give that leadership .
You need to just go to this , and you , your family , I &apos;m friends , everyone who &apos;s going to work with you , when you &apos;re good , it &apos;s going to grow the rest of everything that they &apos;ve experienced .
We &apos;ve spent a good time , and I &apos;m a believer of why I learned when I was looking at this journey , more than I can tell you for a TED meeting .
But I &apos;m sure it was a big job .
I &apos;ve been very sick for these months .
<unk> and labor to not be true , and I realized that I knew another day : you &apos;re going to be only in the case , if you &apos;re listening to yourself , you &apos;re going to be able to listen to it with this disgusting voice .
As I &apos;m talking about , you can see the pulse of your own self , but you might never be a hero of you .
I want to also stress , and you all know it , and you all know , you know , your team is your team .
People are surrounded by your values and anger , but the language is different .
And I had this idea of success , and I was an amazing wife that today , a great family , ( Applause ) — and brilliant friends , we got as an entrepreneur on a wheelchair , and I had something , in words of people , impossible .
He said , &quot; &quot; The main director of the community in the community told me how I was going to make a decision that would be good when I got seven percent .
I was a bit of a view of his view , and maybe he was wrong , and he was thinking about a valuable force .
But at the day , I decided to show you that he &apos;s wrong .
And it &apos;s really important to measure this , and I &apos;m really very small , and I &apos;ve been working , like people with me .
We &apos;re never allowed to achieve a lot of things if you &apos;re paying attention to ourselves .
And I think this is really important two points : <unk> yourself and right on the right , but it &apos;s not less important if there &apos;s no longer , you have courage to be abused from people and right on the right that you &apos;re going to have , including great blogs and comments .
And I &apos;ve been completely adapted to others , and I decided to get rid of a mustache , partly because of my power of my power on the rest of the hour .
When I was getting a lot of energy at any point — and it was a time from time , pain was a little bit of a puzzle , and it was not just that , but my own rules .
I called our team of Jack , where the letter of x means an intuitive word .
The first thing about them is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I was afraid to make sure , I wanted to be sure , I wanted to teach the leaders as an initiative as an ambassador of our work as a <unk> company .
The second word is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or the joy .
I decided to love it .
It could take a lot of , even though it was a problem of the problem .
And I &apos;ve been doing all sorts of ways to inspire that other .
The language of words is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was open for all the questions .
I didn &apos;t have a <unk> , all of you could learn Facebook or on our skin .
I think I &apos;m going to take a lecture , you &apos;re going to have the answer to your questions .
Even the more important words that we don &apos;t have to say , we put a company from the principle of <unk> — women power .
( Cheers ) And I &apos;m really glad that I found courage to make sure that I &apos;m afraid , but to be successful for a lot of people .
I can &apos;t tell you that it was simple , but I &apos;m convinced , and I think the whole team is lying , it was worth .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not going to give you . Charlie Thwaites : My favorite hand . PM : I can &apos;t do you , don &apos;t test you .
And maybe all of this room is ready to go to Atlanta and worry for you .
We &apos;re not going to be able to have a voice there , but there &apos;s something that we can do in France , like before , that &apos;s the urge .
I mean , it &apos;s hard enough to remember a year in order to remember the last year when women were born on the street , and that really became a big threat to the launch of the woman &apos;s flight .
You &apos;ve talked about this girl before , and let &apos;s see a picture to remind you how the country looked at the table .
And you may not know , the American media didn &apos;t look at this , but in the <unk> woman , he went back to the street . Right ?
JT : Yeah . PM : Can we tell us about this ?
JT : 41 years after that , we can find the best place in the world to be women , but our work is not going to be done .
So , in the hospital , <unk> , women in the 1930s left work , because that &apos;s the time they made their daily childhood .
( Applause ) My motto was that young women and girls were forced to pay more than before before , because the hour of the number of time was a lot of money .
PM : I &apos;m not going to remember the Hulk about her future plans , but I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to have a great <unk> , if you want to do it again .
Thank you , Khalil .
JT : Thank you very much .
( Applause )
In fact , I tried to think about my career , as I left the Buddha of the house , and the best example that I &apos;m here is an astronaut in the Apollo Miner a couple of years ago .
The boy &apos;s boy , looking at the spider , says , &quot; &quot; Dad , when I grew up , I want to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I made a lot of courage as the former president of the world , because I made access to a few people in the world to meet people in the rest of the world .
I &apos;m not only about 50 states in America , but we &apos;ve experienced more than 140 countries in the world .
We &apos;re not only born with the weather or the president , but they &apos;re also going to raise the local communities that live in the most prestigious neighborhoods of Africa .
It &apos;s a commitment to human rights , and you know the light as you know it , you can tell you without the two of them who are so often given the eyes , which is violence about women and women .
There are a couple of reasons I &apos;m sorry .
First of all , this is a <unk> explanation of the religious fiction , the holy <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the Koran , and so forth .
They &apos;re combining these gaps to ensure that women are likely to be married by the differences of men in the face of God .
So a few years ago , in 2000 , I was a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> for 70 years — I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m still going to go to the emergency school every day , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to teach you — but South <unk> , in 2000 , decided that men .
So they put a vase , which , in fact , can be able to get women to be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> , if the woman &apos;s teaching in the classroom in the South Academy of Alabama , she can &apos;t teach if a boy in the room , because you can find a poem in Bombay , and in Bhutan , more than 30,000 poems , where the woman doesn &apos;t have to learn men , and so on .
But the basic thing is that the expression of the fear of being happy to get men into more high laughter .
It &apos;s a common-sense problem , because men can hold power , for example , when the male or the employer want to be a tiger .
Why do I need to pay them to pay the same work ?
And that &apos;s what &apos;s causing this problem — the benefits of the return to violence .
In the United States , for example , we &apos;ve had a <unk> increase of the <unk> , the main symptoms of the black people and fewer things that were organized in prison .
One of 1,000 Americans was in jail .
Today , 73 people from 1,000 deaths in prison .
It &apos;s a tragic increase .
Since I left the Bamiyan House , there was a reduction of 80 percent of the dark women in prison .
We &apos;re one of the <unk> countries on the Earth , which is still a little bit of <unk> , from the development of the country .
We &apos;re doing a place in one of the countries that most of the most disadvantaged people are going to do .
We &apos;re here in California , and I learned in the days that the <unk> was four billion dollars to celebrate 13 people to kill 13 people .
I &apos;m going to get a person on the mouth .
It took a law for this week , which is the rule of the poor <unk> , the <unk> of violence and fear of poverty and <unk> people , and it &apos;s another one of the prevalence of violence on women .
I &apos;m going to be very short .
Some of them have a <unk> organ .
But in some countries , in many countries , when a girl is born , shortly in her life , she &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a little bit
Sometimes , in the most advanced scenario , it &apos;s going to be clear that the girl can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this ?
And then , when she comes married , this is the same time that you could have sex .
It &apos;s not rare , but it &apos;s against the law .
Egypt , for example , 99 percent of all women who live in Egypt today were sexy .
Some countries are more than 98 percent of women who have been convicted of doing this .
It &apos;s a terrible obligation for all women who live in those countries .
One is a very powerful thing — where family , I &apos;m not sure , is nothing in the Koran , that it &apos;s a girl with her family , and if she was a <unk> or if she was married or she was married or sometimes , even if she would play her .
It &apos;s going to be a member of your family , and the family , I &apos;m going to get a fisherman when the girl is going to sell that email to family .
Not so many of the time the A.I. was invented in Egypt , and he noticed that 75 percent of these killings were dying by their parents , boys or brother , 25 percent of the women who died of women .
The great problem that exists in the world in terms of women is slavery , or <unk> people , as it &apos;s called .
It was about 12 million people who were trained in Harvard Avenue in 19 and in 18 centuries .
30 million people live today in slavery .
The U.S. Department of Defense is going to make a decision every year , and the Department of Defense estimates , through the international environment every year , 80 percent of those <unk> — women who have sex slavery .
In the United States , it &apos;s in this moment , 60,000 people live under a <unk> or in slavery .
<unk> , George , where I &apos;m in the Kennedy Institute , and where I &apos;m going to invest in the <unk> <unk> , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , people .
This is the place of one of the country because of this .
And Atlanta is going to have a lot of <unk> .
If the driver of a bar wants to take a girl who &apos;s <unk> , they can do it for 1,000 dollars .
The young girl is providing the <unk> of the Party in Atlanta , and it can be sold by $ 3,000 from slavery .
<unk> <unk> in Atlanta , George .
So this is another very powerful problem , because there &apos;s no <unk> in America , local hospitality , or the teacher .
It &apos;s going to be one of the biggest problems , women are going to buy and kill all over the world .
I &apos;m a good approach to that .
85 years ago , the Russians decided to change law , and women are more likely to do the law when they &apos;re born in sexual <unk> , but the <unk> of the barricades , the <unk> , and — ( Applause ) — they went to the shoulder .
In the United States .
In one man , the <unk> of 25 women were the slaves in the United States .
Canada , Idaho , I said , Canada , France and other countries are going to be right now .
This is the one on the right , which can be created .
We have two big breakthroughs in the country , our <unk> and the great <unk> system .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
The last thing I &apos;ve done is that there are 3,000 .
It &apos;s about 3,000 , a little bit more than one cliff , and the reason is that the team of any organization — the ship , like my <unk> boat , or the <unk> in the <unk> five — the team of my rights rights on the project of the <unk> , and of course , the last thing they want to do with their team is , they don &apos;t do it .
This law has to be transformed .
It &apos;s going to be a lot of confusion for time , and I &apos;m going to have a lot of confusion , partly because of my book , but also because of other things , like the 1918 Institute of America , the <unk> education of education , because the services of Gaza to protect them from sexual violence .
The Department of Justice says , in the middle of the <unk> College , because because of the organizational system , if they come to someone , but if they &apos;re all in the <unk> computer .
They don &apos;t work .
These are things that are happening in our society .
It &apos;s a very good thing to do in the right right in terms of the <unk> of the <unk> as you know . ( Applause ) And that &apos;s sometimes a good thing to see .
When I was president , the difference was 39 percent .
So we had a different progress , and so on — ( Applause ) — but over the last 15 years , it was only about 28 or 28 percent of the last 15 years .
That &apos;s what happens now .
If you take 500 companies , in 28 of their women , 500 , and these <unk> , I &apos;ll tell you that the average average of the average leader .
This is what happens in our country .
One problem from the United States : we &apos;re the most vulnerable country on Earth .
We were in the middle of the war in the era of World War II .
We were in the tents .
And together , we &apos;re shooting on the head , and we &apos;re going to go to the front of people .
Sometimes , of course , we have a lot of <unk> .
We were in the state of 25 different countries or more after World War II .
For the age of the years , I &apos;m not going to say , ( Applause ) — we &apos;re not a leader of any pain , we didn &apos;t smoke .
But in any case , these things , in addition to violence , and the <unk> explanation , is the basic causes of violence on women .
One of the most important reasons , Amanda , men .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
There &apos;s a rare man who can say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to be a literary surgeon , it &apos;s very similar to what I was in the literature when I was a pastor , when the differences were invented .
It &apos;s a metaphor of <unk> , the rest of the war between the state , the Civil War , when Linda Jones has given the laws of weather rights .
But for this time , there were many black people who didn &apos;t think that they were not aware of what they were going to do , but they were so excited , because they were used by the emergency access to the courts , the best schools and the rest . That &apos;s what &apos;s happening today , because the typical men , in fact , are in fact .
And if they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m against improvisation , and they use <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of men who are able to control the public system , most men , the <unk> system , the most men who are in the world , and most of the men who are in the world , and most of the men who are in charge of big kings .
What is the basic thing we need to do today ?
I said , the best thing that we could do for women with the most powerful countries like this , and as you &apos;re allies , Europe and so forth , who have a responsibility to contribute to ourselves to be more motivated to be able to finish the gap around the world .
A normal woman in Egypt doesn &apos;t tell me what to say .
But I hope that after this time , women are making their husband , from violence in college colleges and <unk> and <unk> , and in the future of labor , they need to protect their daughters and daughters .
I have 12 grandchildren , and my father and 10 Commandments , I often think about them , and I often think about them , and I &apos;m going to have a modest head , not only if they were on Egypt to have a real truth , and I hope that all you join me to become a champion for women around the world , and protect their rights .
Thank you very much .

When I was a student here at <unk> in the 1970s , the future of the world seemed to be sad .
The population of our population was not stopping .
There was no longer .
Now , the Tasmanian cancer , which is caused by the male flies in the back of the world , was going to be able to take our lives .
The Pharaoh had gone to the forest .
It was gone , and the bright snake gave us a clue .
It &apos;s not going to happen . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s not going to happen . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a chance for a capita per capita per capita on a plan , in the real basis of inflation , which has increased three times .
For me , the average life has increased 30 percent .
The political minority has been turned into two thirds .
You can take food on the soul of our population .
The only species that have become more vegetable , in terms of how they grew up in the <unk> ?
We &apos;ve been looking at the <unk> of the population of the population , and this graph shows the GDP per capita .
To answer this question , you have to understand how human beings are doing their intellect and provide the ability to express their ideas and <unk> .
In other words , you need to understand how to do sex .
I want you to imagine what we &apos;ve come from to create these things .
For 30,000 generations .
And then , there were some changes , but the device has been able to be able to move down to the <unk> in those times .
It &apos;s fantastic , but it &apos;s true .
At that time , it &apos;s going to be in the right for five years .
And the difference is that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this .
It &apos;s a lot of different materials , from the <unk> and the <unk> .
And more than the combination of different ideas — the idea of the plastics , the idea of <unk> , the idea of the trajectory .
They were in the United States with this technology .
And this is the <unk> , this is a fictional technology , because I think it &apos;s the key to think about what happens in the world .
My body is also a combination of ideas : the idea of the skin cell , the idea of the brain of the brain , the idea of a cup of sand .
They &apos;ve collected together .
How do you change something that &apos;s cheap or cheaper ?
She &apos;s using a <unk> .
In the <unk> species , if you get two different compositions in different people .
One of the things that you have to do is to get a second .
In a species of glass , it can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
So , this is the ability to give a person to identify the chemical innovation of all the species .
It &apos;s not going to cover your own chemistry .
So how do we do this in a cultural revolution that has been in biological evolution ?
And I think the answer is that the answer is that it &apos;s a <unk> , a lot of things on the other .
This is a Buddhist human trap .
No animal doesn &apos;t do that .
And it can not be exhausting .
Maybe it &apos;s a <unk> culture .
<unk> , it &apos;s a culture .
They teach one other tradition that goes from their parents .
I &apos;m going to write the edges of the clubs .
But the difference is .
There are different cultures in all kinds of lines .
There are no ideas between them .
So why do we get your own standards ?
The answer came from Daniel <unk> in 1877 .
And write him to think at the second 19th century , which he also described in the words of the country between the country .
Adam takes a <unk> for four hours and three hours .
It &apos;s going to get a little bit of a hour and three hours in two hours .
The best for Adam in a product and a sister , and the shaman .
I &apos;m not talking about Adam .
He can make his attention and <unk> .
If Olu &apos;s worth two breaths and Adam , they &apos;re going to be two inches old .
For more equipment , which gives the momentum to the road , and so on .
Adam and Austin were in the hour of my time .
So , you know , as long as you had to work , you had to work , the hours of a mouse , and you &apos;re going to be able to go back to the book through the book .
When you start with first , you need to go to the village .
How many of you do this ? It &apos;s a lot of time .
How many of you are going to work on a hour of learning and learning for reading if you have a salary in the U.K. ?
In the &apos; 50s , there &apos;s a lot of people in the world .
You won seven or a half seconds of your well-being compared to 1950 .
You &apos;re going to have 15 minutes to participate on that number of losses .
You had to work six hours to go to the urine that &apos;s going to be a clock .
Let &apos;s go back to the <unk> and the computer , and we say , &quot; Who did them and for someone ? &quot;
From the top of the left , it was made for me with other people .
How much people did it ?
Satisfied ? <unk> ? Are you ?
You know , I think millions .
It &apos;s going to be a computer mouse for me to make a computer mouse for me .
And that &apos;s how society works .
This is what we &apos;re just as biological species .
If you were wealthy when you were wealthy , people are literally working on you .
They gave him the <unk> wolves , and they made it , and they made a bad <unk> , and it &apos;s all in that .
<unk> people were preparing him to lunch .
But the modern tour that &apos;s <unk> by Craig Jeremy is also going to bury dinner .
They &apos;re in the <unk> , the restaurants , the restaurants , and the shops in the middle of the Pantheon , and they &apos;re ready to send you healthy food through hours after the hour , the quality of which you &apos;re blind .
You know , we &apos;re going to be able to get the standards of each one .
In fact , there are other animals that are working on one one .
It &apos;s a classic example .
Paul &apos;s left is the answer for the kiss .
In England , we &apos;re not going to transmit the <unk> .
( Applause ) If we started doing this behavior ?
It was a lot of fun .
But I don &apos;t have an idea of that .
There was a lot of work with food .
It &apos;s an amazing role of men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it &apos;s going to take the rise of the bacteria .
Woman knows .
And the guy knows that he doesn &apos;t have to go to the <unk> .
All you need to do is to make sure that we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
The Neanderthals didn &apos;t do that .
They were highly <unk> species .
They were very smart species .
But there were no evidence that they had a lot of jobs .
There are no evidence for women .
And you can see that women were born together with men .
There &apos;s no evidence of the difference between the nation , because we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have the <unk> of the <unk> , the tools that they &apos;ve done , always made with local materials .
For example , in Kibera , there &apos;s a place where they were organized by the local device of Neanderthals .
They &apos;re always made with the local tower .
At the same time , there are a bunch of modern people who have been in a very distant way .
When the person began to move things like this , this is the evidence that they were separated between the ground .
I &apos;m going to give you a dozen times for the population .
And the early phase of this is where you can see that there are <unk> years ago in Africa , where we see that the prophets , nuclei and others are going to find a big drop from Enceladus .
Also , mantis cancer — as a teenager , was 200 kilometers away from the <unk> of Illinois .
And it &apos;s proof that groups started to be divided .
And this led to a machine .
They put them out of their neighbors in exile like the <unk> , and in the result of some of the <unk> <unk> .
What happens when you get people from a deer , from the ability to get the <unk> and make it happen ?
The answer is that it &apos;s not just going to try to change the technology of progress , but we can even turn it into the opposite direction .
The size of this is <unk> .
The speed of progress compared to people with the mast , they really have a lot of material .
Because we have a population in 4,000 people who have been not big enough to protect the prosthetic skills that need to protect their technology .
The dark thing happened in the <unk> de <unk> .
The fact is that Sir <unk> de <unk> is a lot more than South America .
And they were <unk> .
Come back again and ask yourself , not just who did it and for someone , but who knew how to do that ?
No one , almost one .
A man on a digital line doesn &apos;t know .
I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , the famous philosopher of <unk> Russell , the 1920s of the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , <unk> , &quot; &quot; which he wrote as an instrument of glass , and nobody knows how to make a needle , because people don &apos;t know how to make a piano , and they don &apos;t know how to rob trees and everything .
What we &apos;ve done in the modern society , the way that we &apos;re <unk> and a surgeon — we &apos;ve created opportunities to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not what the language is .
But thanks to technology , we &apos;re going to be able to do this .
In fact , because I don &apos;t care about the level of intelligence , whether some groups are more high than other groups than other groups .
It &apos;s not my fault .
It &apos;s a matter of how good people are sending their ideas , and how good they &apos;re competing , not how the individual individual is .
We created a collective brain .
We &apos;re just heroes in the audience .
We &apos;re not taking this brain .
The idea of ideas , a teacher , and the answer to the idea of one of one of the problems of the development of progress , is to be able to be able to be able to go on .
You &apos;re not less and bad things .
In the future , as we &apos;re going to go forward , we have a lot of things .
It &apos;s going to be green , depression , natural <unk> .
<unk> things in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also sure that because of the connections that people are capable of , the ability to come together and have a lot of great things , I &apos;m also sure that technology will be done .
Because through the rider , through the <unk> , you can create their ideas .
Thank you .
